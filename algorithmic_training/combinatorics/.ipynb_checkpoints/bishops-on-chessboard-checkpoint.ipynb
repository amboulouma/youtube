    "Let's enumerate the diagonals of the chessboard as follows: black diagonals have odd indices, white diagonals have even indices, and the diagonals are numbered in non-decreasing order of the number of squares in them. Here is an example for a $5 \\times 5$ chessboard.\n",

    "\n",
    "We can calculate `D[i][j]` using only values of `D[i-2]` (we subtract 2 because we only consider diagonals of the same color as $i$).\n",
    "There are two ways to get `D[i][j]`.\n",
    "Either we place all `j` bishops on previous diagonals: then there are `D[i-2][j]` ways to achieve this.\n",
    "Or we place one bishop on diagonal `i` and `j-1` bishops on previous diagonals.\n",
    "The number of ways to do this equals the number of squares in diagonal `i` minus `j-1`, because each of `j-1` bishops placed on previous diagonals will block one square on the current diagonal.\n",
