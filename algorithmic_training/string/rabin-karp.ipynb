    "# Rabin-Karp Algorithm for string matching\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm is based on the concept of hashing, so if you are not familiar with string hashing, refer to the [string hashing](./string/string-hashing.html) article.\n",
    " \n",
    "This algorithm was authored by Rabin and Karp in 1987.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem: Given two strings - a pattern $s$ and a text $t$, determine if the pattern appears in the text and if it does, enumerate all its occurrences in $O(|s| + |t|)$ time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm: Calculate the hash for the pattern $s$.\n",
    "Calculate hash values for all the prefixes of the text $t$.\n",
    "Now, we can compare a substring of length $|s|$ with $s$ in constant time using the calculated hashes.\n",
    "So, compare each substring of length $|s|$ with the pattern. This will take a total of $O(|t|)$ time.\n",
    "Hence the final complexity of the algorithm is $O(|t| + |s|)$: $O(|s|)$ is required for calculating the hash of the pattern and $O(|t|)$ for comparing each substring of length $|s|$ with the pattern.\n",
