    "# Suffix Array\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $s$ be a string of length $n$. The $i$-th suffix of $s$ is the substring $s[i \\ldots n - 1]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **suffix array** will contain integers that represent the **starting indexes** of the all the suffixes of a given string, after the aforementioned suffixes are sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example look at the string $s = abaab$.\n",
    "All suffixes are as follows\n",
    "$$\\begin{array}{ll}\n",
    "0. & abaab \\\\\\\\\n",
    "1. & baab \\\\\\\\\n",
    "2. & aab \\\\\\\\\n",
    "3. & ab \\\\\\\\\n",
    "4. & b\n",
    "\\end{array}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "After sorting these strings:\n",
    "$$\\begin{array}{ll}\n",
    "2. & aab \\\\\\\\\n",
    "3. & ab \\\\\\\\\n",
    "0. & abaab \\\\\\\\\n",
    "4. & b \\\\\\\\\n",
    "1. & baab\n",
    "\\end{array}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore the suffix array for $s$ will be $(2,~ 3,~ 0,~ 4,~ 1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data structure it is widely used in areas such as data compression, bioinformatics and, in general, in any area that deals with strings and string matching problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Construction\n",
    "\n",
    "### $O(n^2 \\log n)$ approach\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most naive approach.\n",
    "Get all the suffixes and sort them using quicksort or mergesort and simultaneously retain their original indices.\n",
    "Sorting uses $O(n \\log n)$ comparisons, and since comparing two strings will additionally take $O(n)$ time, we get the final complexity of $O(n^2 \\log n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### $O(n \\log n)$ approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Strictly speaking the following algorithm will not sort the suffixes, but rather the cyclic shifts of a string.\n",
    "However we can very easily derive an algorithm for sorting suffixes from it:\n",
    "it is enough to append an arbitrary character to the end of the string which is smaller than any character from the string.\n",
    "It is common to use the symbol $\\\\$$.\n",
    "Then the order of the sorted cyclic shifts is equivalent to the order of the sorted suffixes, as demonstrated here with the string $dabbb$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{array}{lll}\n",
    "1. & abbb\\\\$d & abbb \\\\\\\\\n",
    "4. & b\\\\$dabb & b \\\\\\\\\n",
    "3. & bb\\\\$dab & bb \\\\\\\\\n",
    "2. & bbb\\\\$da & bbb \\\\\\\\\n",
    "0. & dabbb\\\\$ & dabbb\n",
    "\\end{array}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are going to sort cyclic shifts, we will consider **cyclic substrings**.\n",
    "We will use the notation $s[i \\dots j]$ for the substring of $s$ even if $i > j$.\n",
    "In this case we actually mean the string $s[i \\dots n-1] + s[0 \\dots j]$.\n",
    "In addition we will take all indices modulo the length of $s$, and will omit the modulo operation for simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm we discuss will perform $\\lceil \\log n \\rceil + 1$ iterations.\n",
    "In the $k$-th iteration ($k = 0 \\dots \\lceil \\log n \\rceil$) we sort the $n$ cyclic substrings of $s$ of length $2^k$.\n",
    "After the $\\lceil \\log n \\rceil$-th iteration the substrings of length $2^{\\lceil \\log n \\rceil} \\ge n$ will be sorted, so this is equivalent to sorting the cyclic shifts altogether.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each iteration of the algorithm, in addition to the permutation $p[0 \\dots n-1]$, where $p[i]$ is the index of the $i$-th substring (starting at $i$ and with length $2^k$) in the sorted order, we will also maintain an array $c[0 \\dots n-1]$, where $c[i]$ corresponds to the **equivalence class** to which the substring belongs.\n",
    "Because some of the substrings will be identical, and the algorithm needs to treat them equally.\n",
    "For convenience the classes will be labeled by numbers started from zero.\n",
    "In addition the numbers $c[i]$ will be assigned in such a way that they preserve information about the order:\n",
    "if one substring is smaller than the other, then it should also have a smaller class label.\n",
    "The number of equivalence classes will be stored in a variable $\\text{classes}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example.\n",
    "Consider the string $s = aaba$.\n",
    "The cyclic substrings and the corresponding arrays $p[]$ and $c[]$ are given for each iteration:\n",
    "$$\\begin{array}{cccc}\n",
    "0: & (a,~ a,~ b,~ a) & p = (0,~ 1,~ 3,~ 2) & c = (0,~ 0,~ 1,~ 0)\\\\\\\\\n",
    "1: & (aa,~ ab,~ ba,~ aa) & p = (0,~ 3,~ 1,~ 2) & c = (0,~ 1,~ 2,~ 0)\\\\\\\\\n",
    "2: & (aaba,~ abaa,~ baaa,~ aaab) & p = (3,~ 0,~ 1,~ 2) & c = (1,~ 2,~ 3,~ 0)\\\\\\\\\n",
    "\\end{array}$$\n",
    "It is worth noting that the values of $p[]$ can be different.\n",
    "For example in the $0$-th iteration the array could also be $p = (3,~ 1,~ 0,~ 2)$ or $p = (3,~ 0,~ 1,~ 2)$.\n",
    "All these options permutation the substrings into a sorted order.\n",
    "So they are all valid.\n",
    "At the same time the array $c[]$ is fixed, there can be no ambiguities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now focus on the implementation of the algorithm.\n",
    "We will write a function that takes a string $s$ and returns the permutations of the sorted cyclic shifts.\n",
    "```cpp \n",
    "vector<int> sort_cyclic_shifts(string const& s) {\n",

    "However the second elements were already sorted in the previous iteration.\n",
    "Thus, in order to sort the pairs by the second elements, we just need to subtract $2^{k-1}$ from the indices in $p[]$ (e.g. if the smallest substring of length $2^{k-1}$ starts at position $i$, then the substring of length $2^k$ with the smallest second half starts at $i - 2^{k-1}$).\n",

    "### Finding the smallest cyclic shift\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm above sorts all cyclic shifts (without appending a character to the string), and therefore $p[0]$ gives the position of the smallest cyclic shift. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding a substring in a string\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is to find a string $s$ inside some text $t$ online - we know the text $t$ beforehand, but not the string $s$.\n",
    "We can create the suffix array for the text $t$ in $O(|t| \\log |t|)$ time.\n",
    "Now we can look for the substring $s$ in the following way.\n",
    "The occurrence of $s$ must be a prefix of some suffix from $t$.\n",
    "Since we sorted all the suffixes we can perform a binary search for $s$ in $p$.\n",
    "Comparing the current suffix and the substring $s$ within the binary search can be done in $O(|s|)$ time, therefore the complexity for finding the substring is $O(|s| \\log |t|)$.\n",
    "Also notice that if the substring occurs multiple times in $t$, then all occurrences will be next to each other in $p$.\n",
    "Therefore the number of occurrences can be found with a second binary search, and all occurrences can be printed easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparing two substrings of a string\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to be able to compare two substrings of the same length of a given string $s$ in $O(1)$ time, i.e. checking if the first substring is smaller than the second one.\n",

    "For this we construct the suffix array in $O(|s| \\log |s|)$ time and store all the intermediate results of the equivalence classes $c[]$.\n",

    "This array will give us an answer for any two adjacent suffixes of the string.\n",
    "Then the answer for arbitrary two suffixes, not necessarily neighboring ones, can be obtained from this array.\n",
    "In fact, let the request be to compute the LCP of the suffixes $p[i]$ and $p[j]$.\n",
    "Then the answer to this query will be $\\min(lcp[i],~ lcp[i+1],~ \\dots,~ lcp[j-1])$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus if we have such an array $\\text{lcp}$, then the problem is reduced to the [RMQ](./sequences/rmq.html), which has many wide number of different solutions with different complexities.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the main task is to **build** this array $\\text{lcp}$.\n",
    "We will use **Kasai's algorithm**, which can compute this array in $O(n)$ time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at two adjacent suffixes in the sorted order (order of the suffix array).\n",
    "Let their starting positions be $i$ and $j$ and their $\\text{lcp}$ equal to $k > 0$.\n",
    "If we remove the first letter of both suffixes - i.e. we take the suffixes $i+1$ and $j+1$ - then it should be obvious that the $\\text{lcp}$ of these two is $k - 1$.\n",
    "However we cannot use this value and write it in the $\\text{lcp}$ array, because these two suffixes might not be next to each other in the sorted order.\n",
    "The suffix $i+1$ will of course be smaller than the suffix $j+1$, but there might be some suffixes between them.\n",
    "However, since we know that the LCP between two suffixes is the minimum value of all transitions, we also know that the LCP between any two pairs in that interval has to be at least $k-1$, especially also between $i+1$ and the next suffix.\n",
    "And possibly it can be bigger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we already can implement the algorithm.\n",
    "We will iterate over the suffixes in order of their length. This way we can reuse the last value $k$, since going from suffix $i$ to the suffix $i+1$ is exactly the same as removing the first letter.\n",
    "We will need an additional array $\\text{rank}$, which will give us the position of a suffix in the sorted list of suffixes.\n",
