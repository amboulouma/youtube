    "\n",
    "This game is played on a $4 \\times 4$ board. On this board there are $15$ playing tiles numbered from 1 to 15. One cell is left empty (denoted by 0). You need to get the board to the position presented below by repeatedly moving one of the tiles to the free space:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{matrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\\\\\\\ 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\\\\\\\ 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\\\\\\\ 13 & 14 & 15 & 0 \\end{matrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The game \"15 Puzzle” was created by Noyes Chapman in 1880.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Existence Of The Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider this problem: given a position on the board, determine whether a sequence of moves which leads to a solution exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have some position on the board:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{matrix} a_1 & a_2 & a_3 & a_4 \\\\\\\\ a_5 & a_6 & a_7 & a_8 \\\\\\\\ a_9 & a_{10} & a_{11} & a_{12} \\\\\\\\ a_{13} & a_{14} & a_{15} & a_{16} \\end{matrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where one of the elements equals zero and indicates an empty cell $a_z  = 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s consider the permutation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a_1 a_2 ... a_{z-1} a_{z+1} ... a_{15} a_{16}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "i.e. the permutation of numbers corresponding to the position on the board without a zero element\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $N$ be the number of inversions in this permutation (i.e. the number of such elements $a_i$  and $a_j$  that $i < j$, but $a_i  > a_j$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $K$ is an index of a row where the empty element is located (i.e. using our convention, $K = (z - 1) \\div \\ 4 + 1$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, **the solution exists iff $N + K$ is even**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm above can be illustrated with the following program code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "int a[16];\n",
    "for (int i=0; i<16; ++i)\n",
    "    cin >> a[i];\n",
    "\n",

    "            if (a[j] > a[i])\n",
    "                ++inv;\n",
    "for (int i=0; i<16; ++i)\n",
    "    if (a[i] == 0)\n",
    "        inv += 1 + i / 4;\n",

    "## Proof\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1879 Johnson proved that if $N + K$ is odd, then the solution doesn’t exist, and in the same year Story proved that all positions when $N + K$ is even have a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, all these proofs were quite complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1999 Archer proposed a much simpler proof (you can download his article [here](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15859-f01/www/notes/15-puzzle.pdf)).\n",
