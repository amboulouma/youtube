    "We can notice, that it is impossible that all prime factors of a composite number $n$ are bigger than $\\sqrt{n}$.\n",

    "We remove the factor from the number, and repeat the process.\n",

    "\n",
    "It is very likely that at least one factor of a number is $B$**-powersmooth** for small $B$.\n",
    "$B$-powersmooth means, that every power $d^k$ of a prime $d$ that divides $p-1$ is at most $B$.\n",
    "E.g. the prime factorization of $4817191$ are is $1303 \\cdot 3697$.\n",
    "And the factors are $31$-powersmooth and $16$-powersmooth respectably, because $1303 - 1 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 31$ and $3697 - 1 = 2^4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11$.\n",
    "In 1974 John Pollard invented a method to extracts $B$-powersmooth factors from a composite number.\n",

    "The algorithm and returns true as soon as it detects a cycle.\n",

    "\n",

    "The straightforward implementation using Brent's algorithms can be speeded up by noticing, that we can omit the terms $x_l - x_k$ if $k < \\frac{3 \\cdot l}{2}$.\n",
