    "# Fast Fourier transform\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article we will discuss an algorithm that allows us to multiply two polynomials of length $n$ in $O(n \\log n)$ time, which is better than the trivial multiplication which takes $O(n^2)$ time.\n",
    "Obviously also multiplying two long numbers can be reduced to multiplying polynomials, so also two long numbers can be multiplied in $O(n \\log n)$ time (where $n$ is the number of digits in the numbers).\n",
    "\n",
    "The discovery of the **Fast Fourier transformation (FFT)** is attributed to Cooley and Tukey, who published an algorithm in 1965.\n",
    "But in fact the FFT has been discovered repeatedly before, but the importance of it was not understood before the inventions of modern computers.\n",
    "Some researchers attribute the discovery of the FFT to Runge and König in 1924.\n",
    "But actually Gauss developed such a method already in 1805, but never published it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice, that the FFT algorithm presented here runs in $O(n \\log n)$ time, but it doesn't work for multiplying arbitrary big polynomials with arbitrary large coefficients or for multiplying arbitrary big integers.\n",
    "It can easily handle polynomials of size $10^5$ with small coefficients, or multiplying two numbers of size $10^6$, but at some point the range and the precision of the used floating point numbers will not no longer be enough to give accurate results.\n",
    "That is usually enough for solving competitive programming problems, but there are also more complex variations that can perform arbitrary large polynomial/integer multiplications.\n",
    "E.g. in 1971 Schönhage and Strasser developed a variation for multiplying arbitrary large numbers that applies the FFT recursively in rings structures running in $O(n \\log n \\log \\log n)$.\n",
    "And recently (in 2019) Harvey and van der Hoeven published an algorithm that runs in true $O(\\log n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discrete Fourier transform\n",
    "\n",
    "Let there be a polynomial of degree $n - 1$:\n",
    "$$A(x) = a_0 x^0 + a_1 x^1 + \\dots + a_{n-1} x^{n-1}$$\n",
    "Without loss of generality we assume that $n$ - the number of coefficients - is a power of $2$.\n",
    "If $n$ is not a power of $2$, then we simply add the missing terms $a_i x^i$ and set the coefficients $a_i$ to $0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The theory of complex numbers tells us that the equation $x^n = 1$ has $n$ complex solutions (called the $n$-th roots of unity), and the solutions are of the form $w_{n, k} = e^{\\frac{2 k \\pi i}{n}}$ with $k = 0 \\dots n-1$.\n",
    "Additionally these complex numbers have some very interesting properties:\n",
    "e.g. the principal $n$-th root $w_n = w_{n, 1} = e^{\\frac{2 \\pi i}{n}}$ can be used to describe all other $n$-th roots: $w_{n, k} = (w_n)^k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **discrete Fourier transform (DFT)** of the polynomial $A(x)$ (or equivalently the vector of coefficients $(a_0, a_1, \\dots, a_{n-1})$ is defined as the values of the polynomial at the points $x = w_{n, k}$, i.e. it is the vector:\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\text{DFT}(a_0, a_1, \\dots, a_{n-1}) &= (y_0, y_1, \\dots, y_{n-1}) \\\\\\\\\n",
    "&= (A(w_{n, 0}), A(w_{n, 1}), \\dots, A(w_{n, n-1})) \\\\\\\\\n",
    "&= (A(w_n^0), A(w_n^1), \\dots, A(w_n^{n-1}))\n",
    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly the **inverse discrete Fourier transform** is defined:\n",
    "The inverse DFT of values of the polynomial $(y_0, y_1, \\dots, y_{n-1})$ are the coefficients of the polynomial $(a_0, a_1, \\dots, a_{n-1})$.\n",
    "$$\\text{InverseDFT}(y_0, y_1, \\dots, y_{n-1}) = (a_0, a_1, \\dots, a_{n-1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, if a direct DFT computes the values of the polynomial at the points at the $n$-th roots, the inverse DFT can restore the coefficients of the polynomial using those values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application of the DFT: fast multiplication of polynomials\n",
    "\n",
    "Let there be two polynomials $A$ and $B$.\n",
    "We compute the DFT for each of them: $\\text{DFT}(A)$ and $\\text{DFT}(B)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens if we multiply these polynomials?\n",
    "Obviously at each point the values are simply multiplied, i.e.\n",
    "$$(A \\cdot B)(x) = A(x) \\cdot B(x).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that if we multiply the vectors $\\text{DFT}(A)$ and $\\text{DFT}(B)$ - by multiplying each element of one vector by the corresponding element of the other vector - then we get nothing other than the DFT of the polynomial $\\text{DFT}(A \\cdot B)$:\n",
    "$$\\text{DFT}(A \\cdot B) = \\text{DFT}(A) \\cdot \\text{DFT}(B)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, applying the inverse DFT, we obtain:\n",
    "$$A \\cdot B = \\text{InverseDFT}(\\text{DFT}(A) \\cdot \\text{DFT}(B))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "On the right the product of the two DFTs we mean the pairwise product of the vector elements.\n",
    "This can be computed in $O(n)$ time.\n",
    "If we can compute the DFT and the inverse DFT in $O(n \\log n)$, then we can compute the product of the two polynomials (and consequently also two long numbers) with the same time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted, that the two polynomials should have the same degree.\n",
    "Otherwise the two result vectors of the DFT have different length.\n",
    "We can accomplish this by adding coefficients with the value $0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "And also, since the result of the product of two polynomials is a polynomial of degree $2 (n - 1)$, we have to double the degrees of each polynomial (again by padding $0$s).\n",
    "From a vector with $n$ values we cannot reconstruct the desired polynomial with $2n - 1$ coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fast Fourier Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "The **fast Fourier transform** is a method that allows computing the DFT in $O(n \\log n)$ time.\n",
    "The basic idea of the FFT is to apply divide and conquer.\n",
    "We divide the coefficient vector of the polynomial into two vectors, recursively compute the DFT for each of them, and combine the results to compute the DFT of the complete polynomial.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let there be a polynomial $A(x)$ with degree $n - 1$, where $n$ is a power of $2$, and $n > 1$:\n",
    "$$A(x) = a_0 x^0 + a_1 x^1 + \\dots + a_{n-1} x^{n-1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We divide it into two smaller polynomials, the one containing only the coefficients of the even positions, and the one containing the coefficients of the odd positions:\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\n",
    "A_0(x) &= a_0 x^0 + a_2 x^1 + \\dots + a_{n-2} x^{\\frac{n}{2}-1} \\\\\\\\\n",
    "A_1(x) &= a_1 x^0 + a_3 x^1 + \\dots + a_{n-1} x^{\\frac{n}{2}-1}\n",
    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy to see that\n",
    "$$A(x) = A_0(x^2) + x A_1(x^2).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The polynomials $A_0$ and $A_1$ are only half as much coefficients as the polynomial $A$.\n",
    "If we can compute the $\\text{DFT}(A)$ in linear time using $\\text{DFT}(A_0)$ and $\\text{DFT}(A_1)$, then we get the recurrence $T_{\\text{DFT}}(n) = 2 T_{\\text{DFT}}\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right) + O(n)$ for the time complexity, which results in $T_{\\text{DFT}}(n) = O(n \\log n)$ by the **master theorem**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's learn how we can accomplish that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have computed the vectors $\\left(y_k^0\\right)\\_{k=0}^{n/2-1} = \\text{DFT}(A_0)$ and $\\left(y_k^1\\right)\\_{k=0}^{n/2-1} = \\text{DFT}(A_1)$.\n",
    "Let us find a expression for $\\left(y_k\\right)_{k=0}^{n-1} = \\text{DFT}(A)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first $\\frac{n}{2}$ values we can just use the previously noted equation $A(x) = A_0(x^2) + x A_1(x^2)$:\n",
    "$$y_k = y_k^0 + w_n^k y_k^1, \\quad k = 0 \\dots \\frac{n}{2} - 1.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However for the second $\\frac{n}{2}$ values we need to find a slightly, different expression:\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\n",
    "y_{k+n/2} &= A\\left(w_n^{k+n/2}\\right) \\\\\\\\\n",
    "&= A_0\\left(w_n^{2k+n}\\right) + w_n^{k + n/2} A_1\\left(w_n^{2k+n}\\right) \\\\\\\\\n",
    "&= A_0\\left(w_n^{2k} w_n^n\\right) + w_n^k w_n^{n/2} A_1\\left(w_n^{2k} w_n^n\\right) \\\\\\\\\n",
    "&= A_0\\left(w_n^{2k}\\right) - w_n^k A_1\\left(w_n^{2k}\\right) \\\\\\\\\n",
    "&= y_k^0 - w_n^k y_k^1\n",
    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "Here we used again $A(x) = A_0(x^2) + x A_1(x^2)$ and the two identities $w_n^n = 1$ and $w_n^{n/2} = -1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore we get the desired formulas for computing the whole vector $(y_k)$:\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\n",
    "y_k &= y_k^0 + w_n^k y_k^1, &\\quad k = 0 \\dots \\frac{n}{2} - 1, \\\\\\\\\n",
    "y_{k+n/2} &= y_k^0 - w_n^k y_k^1, &\\quad k = 0 \\dots \\frac{n}{2} - 1.\n",
    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "(This pattern $a + b$ and $a - b$ is sometimes called a **butterfly**.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus we learned how to compute the DFT in $O(n \\log n)$ time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inverse FFT\n",
    "\n",
    "Let the vector $(y_0, y_1, \\dots y_{n-1})$ - the values of polynomial $A$ of degree $n - 1$ in the points $x = w_n^k$ - be given.\n",
    "We want to restore the coefficients $(a_0, a_1, \\dots, a_{n-1})$ of the polynomial.\n",
    "This known problem is called **interpolation**, and there are general algorithms for solving it.\n",
    "But in this special case (since we know the values of the points at the roots of unity), we can obtains a much simpler algorithm (that is practically the same as the direct FFT).\n",

    "To increase the efficiency we will switch from the recursive implementation to an iterative one.\n",
