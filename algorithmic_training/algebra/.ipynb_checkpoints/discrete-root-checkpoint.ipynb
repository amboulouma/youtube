    "# Discrete Root\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem of finding a discrete root is defined as follows. Given a prime $n$ and two integers $a$ and $k$, find all $x$ for which:\n",
    "\n",
    "$x^k \\equiv a \\pmod n$\n",
    "\n",
    "## The algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "We will solve this problem by reducing it to the [discrete logarithm problem](./algebra/discrete-log.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's apply the concept of a [primitive root](./algebra/primitive-root.html) modulo $n$. Let $g$ be a primitive root modulo $n$. Note that since $n$ is prime, it must exist, and it can be found in $O(Ans \\cdot \\log \\phi (n) \\cdot \\log n) = O(Ans \\cdot \\log^2 n)$ plus time of factoring $\\phi (n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can easily discard the case where $a = 0$. In this case, obviously there is only one answer: $x = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we know that $n$ is a prime and any number between 1 and $n-1$ can be represented as a power of the primitive root, we can represent the discrete root problem as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$(g^y)^k \\equiv a \\pmod n$\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "\n",
    "$x \\equiv g^y \\pmod n$\n",
    "\n",
    "This, in turn, can be rewritten as\n",
    "\n",
    "$(g^k)^y \\equiv a \\pmod n$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have one unknown $y$, which is a discrete logarithm problem. The solution can be found using Shanks' baby-step giant-step algorithm in $O(\\sqrt {n} \\log n)$ (or we can verify that there are no solutions).\n",
    "\n",
    "Having found one solution $y_0$, one of solutions of discrete root problem will be $x_0 = g^{y_0} \\pmod n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finding all solutions from one known solution\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the given problem in full, we need to find all solutions knowing one of them: $x_0 = g^{y_0} \\pmod n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's recall the fact that a primitive root always has order of $\\phi (n)$, i.e. the smallest power of $g$ which gives 1 is $\\phi (n)$. Therefore, if we add the term $\\phi (n)$ to the exponential, we still get the same value:\n",
    "\n",
    "$x^k \\equiv g^{ y_0 \\cdot k + l \\cdot \\phi (n)} \\equiv a \\pmod n \\forall l \\in Z$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, all the solutions are of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$x = g^{y_0 + \\frac {l \\cdot \\phi (n)}{k}} \\pmod n \\forall l \\in Z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "where $l$ is chosen such that the fraction must be an integer. For this to be true, the numerator has to be divisible by the least common multiple of  $\\phi (n)$ and $k$. Remember that least common multiple of two numbers $lcm(a, b) = \\frac{a \\cdot b}{gcd(a, b)}$; we'll get\n",
    "\n",
    "$x = g^{y_0 + i \\frac {\\phi (n)}{gcd(k, \\phi (n))}} \\pmod n \\forall i \\in Z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the final formula for all solutions of the discrete root problem.\n",
