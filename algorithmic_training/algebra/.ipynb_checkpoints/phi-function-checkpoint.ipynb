    "# Euler's totient function\n",
    "\n",
    "Euler's totient function, also known as **phi-function** $\\phi (n)$, counts the number of integers between 1 and $n$ inclusive, which are coprime to $n$. Two numbers are coprime if their greatest common divisor equals $1$ ($1$ is considered to be coprime to any number).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are values of $\\phi(n)$ for the first few positive integers:\n",
    "$$\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n",
    "\\hline\n",
    "n & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15 & 16 & 17 & 18 & 19 & 20 & 21 \\\\\\\\ \\hline\n",
    "\\phi(n) & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 4 & 2 & 6 & 4 & 6 & 4 & 10 & 4 & 12 & 6 & 8 & 8 & 16 & 6 & 18 & 8 & 12 \\\\\\\\ \\hline\n",
    "\\end{array}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "The following properties of Euler totient function are sufficient to calculate it for any number:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - If $p$ is a prime number, then $\\gcd(p, q) = 1$ for all $1 \\le q < p$. Therefore we have:\n",
    "    $$\\phi (p) = p - 1.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "  - If $p$ is a prime number and $k \\ge 1$, then there are exactly $p^k / p$ numbers between $1$ and $p^k$ that are divisible by $p$.\n",
    "    Which gives us:\n",
    "    $$\\phi(p^k) = p^k - p^{k-1}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "  - If $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime, then:\n",
    "    $$\\phi(a b) = \\phi(a) \\cdot \\phi(b).$$\n",
    "    This relation is not trivial to see. It follows from the [Chinese remainder theorem](../algebra/chinese-remainder-theorem.html). The Chinese remainder theorem guarantees, that for each $0 \\le x < a$ and each $0 \\le y < b$, there exists a unique $0 \\le z < a b$ with $z \\equiv x \\pmod{a}$ and $z \\equiv y \\pmod{b}$. It's not hard to show that $z$ is coprime to $a b$ if and only if $x$ is coprime to $a$ and $y$ is coprime to $b$. Therefore the amount of integers coprime to $a b$ is equal to product of the amounts of $a$ and $b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - In general, for not coprime $a$ and $b$, the equation $$\\phi(ab) = \\phi(a) \\cdot \\phi(b) \\cdot \\dfrac{d}{\\phi(d)}$$ with $d = \\gcd(a, b)$ holds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, using the first three properties, we can compute $\\phi(n)$ through the factorization of $n$ (decomposition of $n$ into a product of its prime factors).\n",
    "If $n = {p_1}^{a_1} \\cdot {p_2}^{a_2} \\cdots {p_k}^{a_k}$, where $p_i$ are prime factors of $n$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\phi (n) &= \\phi ({p_1}^{a_1}) \\cdot \\phi ({p_2}^{a_2}) \\cdots  \\phi ({p_k}^{a_k}) \\\\\\\\\n",
    "&= \\left({p_1}^{a_1} - {p_1}^{a_1 - 1}\\right) \\cdot \\left({p_2}^{a_2} - {p_2}^{a_2 - 1}\\right) \\cdots \\left({p_k}^{a_k} - {p_k}^{a_k - 1}\\right) \\\\\\\\\n",
    "&= p_1^{a_1} \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p_1}\\right) \\cdot p_2^{a_2} \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p_2}\\right) \\cdots p_k^{a_k} \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p_k}\\right) \\\\\\\\\n",
    "&= n \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p_1}\\right) \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p_2}\\right) \\cdots \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p_k}\\right)\n",
    "\\end{align}$$\n",

    "$$a^{\\phi(m)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod m$$ if $a$ and $m$ are relatively prime.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the particular case when $m$ is prime, Euler's theorem turns into **Fermat's little theorem**:\n",
    "$$a^{m - 1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod m$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Euler's theorem and Euler's totient function occur quite often in practical applications, for example both are used to compute the [modular multiplicative inverse](../algebra/module-inverse.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "As immediate consequence we also get the equivalence:\n",
    "$$a^n \\equiv a^{n \\bmod \\phi(m)} \\pmod m$$\n",
    "This allows computing $x^n \\bmod m$ for very big $n$, especially if $n$ is the result of another computation, as it allows to compute $n$ under a modulo.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generalization\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a less known version of the last equivalence, that allows computing $x^n \\bmod m$ efficiently for not coprime $x$ and $m$.\n",
    "For arbitrary $x, m$ and $n \\geq \\log_2 m$:\n",
    "$$x^{n}\\equiv x^{\\phi(m)+[n \\bmod \\phi(m)]} \\mod m$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $p_1, \\dots, p_t$ be common prime divisors of $x$ and $m$, and $k_i$ their exponents in $m$.\n",
    "With those we define $a = p_1^{k_1} \\dots p_t^{k_t}$, which makes $\\frac{m}{a}$ coprime to $x$.\n",
    "And let $k$ be the smallest number such that $a$ divides $x^k$.\n",
    "Assuming $n \\ge k$, we can write:\n",

    "$$\\begin{align}x^n \\bmod m &= \\frac{x^k}{a}ax^{n-k}\\bmod m \\\\\\\\\n",

    "Indeed if $b = cd + r$ with $r < c$, then $ab = acd + ar$ with $ar < ac$.\n",
    "\n",

    "$$x^n \\bmod m = x^k\\left(x^{n-k \\bmod \\phi(\\frac{m}{a})} \\bmod \\frac{m}{a}\\right)\\bmod m.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula is difficult to apply, but we can use it to analyze the behavior of $x^n \\bmod m$. We can see that the sequence of powers $(x^1 \\bmod m, x^2 \\bmod m, x^3 \\bmod m, \\dots)$ enters a cycle of length $\\phi\\left(\\frac{m}{a}\\right)$ after the first $k$ (or less) elements. \n",
    "$\\phi\\left(\\frac{m}{a}\\right)$ divides $\\phi(m)$ (because $a$ and $\\frac{m}{a}$ are coprime we have $\\phi(a) \\cdot \\phi\\left(\\frac{m}{a}\\right) = \\phi(m)$), therefore we can also say that the period has length $\\phi(m)$.\n",
