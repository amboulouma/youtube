    "# Modular Multiplicative Inverse\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "A [modular multiplicative inverse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_multiplicative_inverse) of an integer $a$ is an integer $x$ such that $a \\cdot x$ is congruent to $1$ modular some modulus $m$.\n",
    "To write it in a formal way: we want to find an integer $x$ so that \n",
    "$$a \\cdot x \\equiv 1 \\mod m.$$\n",
    "We will also denote $x$ simply with $a^{-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We should note that the modular inverse does not always exist. For example, let $m = 4$, $a = 2$. \n",
    "By checking all possible values modulo $m$ is should become clear that we cannot find $a^{-1}$ satisfying the above equation. \n",
    "It can be proven that the modular inverse exists if and only if $a$ and $m$ are relatively prime (i.e. $\\gcd(a, m) = 1$).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, we present two methods for finding the modular inverse in case it exists, and one method for finding the modular inverse for all numbers in linear time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finding the Modular Inverse using Extended Euclidean algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following equation (with unknown $x$ and $y$):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a \\cdot x + m \\cdot y = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a [Linear Diophantine equation in two variables](./algebra/linear-diophantine-equation.html).\n",
    "As shown in the linked article, when $\\gcd(a, m) = 1$, the equation has a solution which can be found using the [extended Euclidean algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Euclidean_algorithm).\n",
    "Note that $\\gcd(a, m) = 1$ is also the condition for the modular inverse to exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if we take modulo $m$ of both sides, we can get rid of $m \\cdot y$, and the equation becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a \\cdot x \\equiv 1 \\mod m$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the modular inverse of $a$ is $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "int x, y;\n",
    "int g = extended_euclidean(a, m, x, y);\n",
    "if (g != 1) {\n",
    "    cout << \"No solution!\";\n",
    "}\n",
    "else {\n",
    "    x = (x % m + m) % m;\n",
    "    cout << x << endl;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we way we modify `x`.\n",
    "The resulting `x` from the extended Euclidean algorithm may be negative, so `x % m` might also be negative, and we first have to add `m` to make it positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finding the Modular Inverse using Binary Exponentiation\n",
    "\n",
    "Another method for finding modular inverse is to use Euler's theorem, which states that the following congruence is true if $a$ and $m$ are relatively prime:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a^{\\phi (m)} \\equiv 1 \\mod m$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\phi$ is [Euler's Totient function](./algebra/phi-function.html).\n",
    "Again, note that $a$ and $m$ being relative prime was also the condition for the modular inverse to exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $m$ is a prime number, this simplifies to [Fermat's little theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat's_little_theorem):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a^{m - 1} \\equiv 1 \\mod m$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiply both sides of the above equations by $a^{-1}$, and we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "* For an arbitrary (but coprime) modulus $m$: $a ^ {\\phi (m) - 1} \\equiv a ^{-1} \\mod m$\n",
    "* For a prime modulus $m$: $a ^ {m - 2} \\equiv a ^ {-1} \\mod m$\n",
    "\n",
    "From these results, we can easily find the modular inverse using the [binary exponentiation algorithm](./algebra/binary-exp.html), which works in $O(\\log m)$ time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though this method is easier to understand than the method described in previous paragraph, in the case when $m$ is not a prime number, we need to calculate Euler phi function, which involves factorization of $m$, which might be very hard. If the prime factorization of $m$ is known, then the complexity of this method is $O(\\log m)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finding the modular inverse for every number modulo $m$ {#mod-inv-all-num}\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is the following: \n",
    "we want to compute the modular inverse for every number in the range $[1, m-1]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying the algorithms described in the previous sections, we can obtain a solution with complexity $O(m \\log m)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we present a better algorithm with complexity $O(m)$.\n",
    "However for this specific algorithm we require that the modulus $m$ is prime.\n",
    "\n",
    "We denote by $\\text{inv}[i]$ the modular inverse of $i$. Then for $i > 1$ the following equation is valid:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{inv}[i] = - \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{i} \\right\\rfloor \\cdot \\text{inv}[m \\bmod i] \\bmod m$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the implementation is very simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "inv[1] = 1;\n",
    "for(int i = 2; i < m; ++i)\n",
    "    inv[i] = m - (m/i) * inv[m%i] % m;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proof\n",
    "\n",
    "We have:\n",
    "$$m \\bmod i = m -  \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{i} \\right\\rfloor \\cdot i$$\n",
    "Taking both sides modulo $m$ yields:\n",
    "$$m \\bmod i \\equiv - \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{i} \\right\\rfloor \\cdot i \\mod m$$\n",
    "Multiply both sides by $i^{-1} \\cdot (m \\bmod i)^{-1}$ yields\n",
    "$$(m \\bmod i) \\cdot i^{-1} \\cdot (m \\bmod i)^{-1} \\equiv -\\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{i} \\right\\rfloor \\cdot i \\cdot i^{-1} \\cdot (m \\bmod i)^{-1} \\mod m,$$\n",
    "which simplifies to:\n",
    "$$i^{-1} \\equiv -\\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{i} \\right\\rfloor \\cdot (m \\bmod i)^{-1} \\mod m,$$\n"
