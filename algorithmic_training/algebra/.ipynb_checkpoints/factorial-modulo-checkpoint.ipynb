    "In some cases it is necessary to consider complex formulas modulo some prime $p$, containing factorials in both numerator and denominator, like such that you encounter in the formula for Binomial coefficients.\n",
    "We consider the case when $p$ is relatively small.\n",
    "This problem makes only sense when the factorials appear in both numerator and denominator of fractions.\n",
    "Otherwise $p!$ and subsequent terms will reduce to zero.\n",
    "But in fractions the factors of $p$ can cancel, and the resulting expression will be non-zero modulo $p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, formally the task is: You want to calculate $n! \\bmod p$, without taking all the multiple factors of $p$ into account that appear in the factorial.\n",
    "Imaging you write down the prime factorization of $n!$, remove all factors $p$, and compute the product modulo $p$.\n",
    "We will denote this *modified* factorial with $n!\\_{\\%p}$.\n",
    "For instance $7!_{\\%p} \\equiv 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\underbrace{1}\\_{3} \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 \\underbrace{2}\\_{6} \\cdot 7 \\equiv 2 \\bmod 3$.\n",

    "\n",
    "We have exactly $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p} \\rfloor$ such blocks, therefore we need to raise $-1$ to the power of $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p} \\rfloor$.\n",
    "This can be done in logarithmic time using [Binary Exponentiation](./algebra/binary-exp.html); however you can also notice that the result will switch between $-1$ and $1$, so we only need to look at the parity of the exponent and multiply by $-1$ if the parity is odd.\n",
