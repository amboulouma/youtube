    "This is a non-standard but still positional **numeral system**. Its feature is that digits can have one of the values `-1`, `0` and `1`.\n",
    "Nevertheless, its base is still `3` (because there are three possible values). Since it is not convenient to write `-1` as a digit,\n",
    "we'll use letter `Z` further for this purpose. If you think it is quite a strange system - look at the picture - here is one of the\n",
    "computers utilizing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "So here are few first numbers written in balanced ternary:\n",

    "It is easy to represent a given number in **balanced ternary** via temporary representing it in normal ternary number system. When value is\n",
    "in standard ternary, its digits are either `0` or `1` or `2`. Iterating from the lowest digit we can safely skip any `0`s and `1`s,\n",
    "however `2` should be turned into `Z` with adding `1` to the next digit. Digits `3` should be turned into `0` on the same terms -\n",
    "such digits are not present in the number initially but they can be encountered after increasing some `2`s.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:** Let us convert `64` to balanced ternary. At first we use normal ternary to rewrite the number:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 64_{10} = 02101_{3} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us process it from the least significant (rightmost) digit:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `1`,`0` and `1` are skipped as it is.( Because `0` and `1` are allowed in balanced ternary )\n",
    "- `2` is turned into `Z` increasing the digit to its left, so we get `1Z101`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final result is `1Z101`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us convert it back to the decimal system by adding the weighted positional values:\n",
    "$$ 1Z101 = 81 \\cdot 1 + 27 \\cdot (-1) + 9 \\cdot 1 + 3 \\cdot 0 + 1 \\cdot 1 = 64_{10} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2:** Let us convert `237` to balanced ternary. At first we use normal ternary to rewrite the number:\n",

    "\n",
    "- `0` and `1` are skipped as it is.( Because `0` and `1` are allowed in balanced ternary )\n",
    "- `2` is turned into `Z` increasing the digit to its left, so we get `23Z10`.\n",
    "- `3` is turned into `0` increasing the digit to its left, so we get `30Z10`.\n",
    "- `3` is turned into `0` increasing the digit to its left( which is by default `0` ), and so we get `100Z10`.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Let us convert it back to the decimal system by adding the weighted positional values:\n",
