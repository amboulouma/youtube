    "# Primitive Root\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "In modular arithmetic, a number $g$ is called a `primitive root modulo n` if every number coprime to $n$ is congruent to a power of $g$ modulo $n$. Mathematically, $g$ is a `primitive root modulo n` if and only if for any integer $a$ such that $\\gcd(a, n) = 1$, there exists an integer $k$ such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$g^k \\equiv a \\pmod n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$k$ is then called the `index` or `discrete logarithm` of $a$ to the base $g$ modulo $n$. $g$ is also called the `generator` of the multiplicative group of integers modulo $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, for the case where $n$ is a prime, the powers of primitive root runs through all numbers from $1$ to $n-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Existence\n",
    "\n",
    "Primitive root modulo $n$ exists if and only if:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $n$ is 1, 2, 4, or\n",
    "* $n$ is power of an odd prime number $(n = p^k)$, or\n",
    "* $n$ is twice power of an odd prime number $(n = 2 \\cdot p^k)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This theorem was proved by Gauss in 1801.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relation with the Euler function\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $g$ be a primitive root modulo $n$. Then we can show that the smallest number $k$ for which $g^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod n$ is equal $\\phi (n)$. Moreover, the reverse is also true, and this fact will be used in this article to find a primitive root.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the number of primitive roots modulo $n$, if there are any, is equal to $\\phi (\\phi (n) )$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm for finding a primitive root\n",
    "\n",
    "A naive algorithm is to consider all numbers in range $[1, n-1]$. And then check if each one is a primitive root, by calculating all its power to see if they are all different. This algorithm has complexity $O(g \\cdot n)$, which would be too slow. In this section, we propose a faster algorithm using several well-known theorems.\n",
    "\n",
    "From previous section, we know that if the smallest number $k$ for which $g^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod n$ is $\\phi (n)$, then $g$ is a primitive root. Since for any number $a$ relative prime to $n$, we know from Euler's theorem that $a ^ { \\phi (n) } \\equiv 1 \\pmod n$, then to check if $g$ is primitive root, it is enough to check that for all $d$ less than $\\phi (n)$, $g^d \\not \\equiv 1 \\pmod n$. However, this algorithm is still too slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "From Lagrange's theorem, we know that the index of 1 of any number modulo $n$ must be a divisor of $\\phi (n)$. Thus, it is sufficient to verify for all proper divisor $d \\mid \\phi (n)$ that $g^d \\not \\equiv 1 \\pmod n$. This is already a much faster algorithm, but we can still do better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Factorize $\\phi (n) = p_1 ^ {a_1} \\cdots p_s ^ {a_s}$. We prove that in the previous algorithm, it is sufficient to consider only the values of $d$ which have the form $\\frac { \\phi (n) } {p_j}$. Indeed, let $d$ be any proper divisor of $\\phi (n)$. Then, obviously, there exists such $j$ that $d \\mid \\frac { \\phi (n) } {p_j}$, i.e. $d \\cdot k = \\frac { \\phi (n) } {p_j}$. However, if $g^d \\equiv 1 \\pmod n$, we would get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$g ^ { \\frac { \\phi (n)} {p_j} } \\equiv g ^ {d \\cdot k} \\equiv (g^d) ^k \\equiv 1^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "i.e. among the numbers of the form $\\frac {\\phi (n)} {p_i}$, there would be at least one such that the conditions were not met.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have a complete algorithm for finding the primitive root:\n",
    "\n",
    "* First, find $\\phi (n)$ and factorize it.\n",
    "* Then iterate through all numbers $g \\in [1, n]$, and for each number, to check if it is primitive root, we do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Calculate all $g ^ { \\frac {\\phi (n)} {p_i}} \\pmod n$.\n",
    "    * If all the calculated values are different from $1$, then $g$ is a primitive root.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Running time of this algorithm is $O(Ans \\cdot \\log \\phi (n) \\cdot \\log n)$ (assume that $\\phi (n)$ has $\\log \\phi (n)$ divisors).\n",
    "\n",
    "Shoup (1990, 1992) proved, assuming the [generalized Riemann hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_Riemann_hypothesis), that $g$ is $O(\\log^6 p)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code assumes that the modulo `p` is a prime number. To make it works for any value of `p`, we must add calculation of $\\phi (p)$. \n",
