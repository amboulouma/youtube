    "# Discrete Logarithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The discrete logarithm is an integer $x$ satisfying the equation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a^x \\equiv b \\pmod m$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for given integers $a$, $b$ and $m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The discrete logarithm does not always exist, for instance there is no solution to $2^x \\equiv 3 \\pmod 7$. There is no simple condition to determine if the discrete logarithm exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, we describe the **Baby-step giant-step** algorithm, an algorithm to compute the discrete logarithm proposed by Shanks in 1971, which has the time complexity $O(\\sqrt{m})$. This is a **meet-in-the-middle** algorithm because it uses the technique of separating tasks in half.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a^x \\equiv b \\pmod m,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $a$ and $m$ are relatively prime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $x = np - q$, where $n$ is some pre-selected constant (we will describe how to select $n$ later). $p$ is known as **giant step**, since increasing it by one increases $x$ by $n$. Similarly, $q$ is known as **baby step**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, any number $x$ in the interval $[0; m)$ can be represented in this form, where $p \\in [1; \\lceil \\frac{m}{n} \\rceil ]$ and $q \\in [0; n]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the equation becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a^{np - q} \\equiv b \\pmod m.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the fact that $a$ and $m$ are relatively prime, we obtain:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a^{np} \\equiv ba^q \\pmod m$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This new equation can be rewritten in a simplified form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f_1(p) = f_2(q).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem can be solved using the meet-in-the-middle method as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Calculate $f_1$ for all possible arguments $p$. Sort the array of value-argument pairs.\n",
    "* For all possible arguments $q$, calculate $f_2$ and look for the corresponding $p$ in the sorted array using binary search.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "We can calculate $f_1(p)$ in $O(\\log m)$ using the [binary exponentation algorithm](./algebra/binary-exp.html). Similarly for $f_2(q)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first step of the algorithm, we need to calculate $f_1$ for every possible argument $p$ and then sort the values. Thus, this step has complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$O\\left(\\left\\lceil \\frac{m}{n} \\right\\rceil \\left(\\log m + \\log \\left\\lceil \\frac{m}{n} \\right\\rceil \\right)\\right) = O\\left( \\left\\lceil \\frac {m}{n} \\right\\rceil \\log m\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second step of the algorithm, we need to calculate $f_2(q)$ for every possible argument $q$ and then do a binary search on the array of values of $f_1$, thus this step has complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$O\\left(n \\left(\\log m + \\log \\frac{m}{n} \\right) \\right) = O\\left(n \\log m\\right).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when we add these two complexities, we get $\\log m$ multiplied by the sum of $n$ and $m/n$, which is minimal when $n = m/n$, which means, to achieve optimal performance, $n$ should be chosen such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$n = \\sqrt{m}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the complexity of the algorithm becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$O(\\sqrt {m} \\log m).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "### The simplest implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, the function `powmod` calculates $a^b \\pmod m$ and the function `solve` produces a proper solution to the problem.\n",
    "It returns $-1$ if there is no solution and returns one of the possible solutions otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",

    "        vals[powmod(a, p * n, m)] = p;\n",
    "    for (int q = 0; q <= n; ++q) {\n",
    "        int cur = (powmod(a, q, m) * 1ll * b) % m;\n",

    "In this code, we used `map` from the C++ standard library to store the values of $f_1$.\n",
    "Internally, `map` uses a red-black tree to store values.\n",
    "Thus this code is a little bit slower than if we had used an array and binary searched, but is much easier to write.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that our code assumes $0^0 = 1$, i.e. the code will compute $0$ as solution for the equation $0^x \\equiv 1 \\pmod m$ and also as solution for $0^x \\equiv 0 \\pmod 1$.\n",

    "Another thing to note is that, if there are multiple arguments $p$ that map to the same value of $f_1$, we only store one such argument.\n",

    "If we need to return all possible solutions, we need to change `map<int, int>` to, say, `map<int, vector<int>>`.\n",
    "We also need to change the second step accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Improved implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "A possible improvement is to get rid of binary exponentiation.\n",
    "This can be done by keeping a variable that is multiplied by $a$ each time we increase $q$ and a variable that is multiplied by $a^n$ each time we increase $p$.\n",
    "With this change, the complexity of the algorithm is still the same, but now the $\\log$ factor is only for the `map`.\n",
    "Instead of a `map`, we can also use a hash table (`unordered_map` in C++) which has the average time complexity $O(1)$ for inserting and searching.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problems often ask for the minimum $x$ which satisfies the solution.  \n",
    "It is possible to get all answers and take the minimum, or reduce the first found answer using [Euler's theorem](./algebra/phi-function.html#toc-tgt-2), but we can be smart about the order in which we calculate values and ensure the first answer we find is the minimum.\n",
