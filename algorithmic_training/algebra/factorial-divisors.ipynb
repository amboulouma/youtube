    "Let's first consider the case of prime $k$. The explicit expression for factorial\n",

    "$$n! = 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\ldots (n-1) \\cdot n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that every $k$-th element of the product is divisible by $k$, i.e. adds $+1$ to the answer; the number of such elements is $\\Bigl\\lfloor\\dfrac{n}{k}\\Bigr\\rfloor$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, every $k^2$-th element is divisible by $k^2$, i.e. adds another $+1$ to the answer (the first power of $k$ has already been counted in the previous paragraph). The number of such elements is $\\Bigl\\lfloor\\dfrac{n}{k^2}\\Bigr\\rfloor$.\n",
    "\n",
    "And so on, for every $i$ each $k^i$-th element adds another $+1$ to the answer, and there are $\\Bigl\\lfloor\\dfrac{n}{k^i}\\Bigr\\rfloor$ such elements.\n",
