    "# Finding Power of Factorial Divisor\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given two numbers $n$ and $k$. Find the largest power of $k$ $x$ such that $n!$ is divisible by $k^x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prime $k$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first consider the case of prime $k$. The explicit expression for factorial\n",
    "\n",
    "$$n! = 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\ldots (n-1) \\cdot n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that every $k$-th element of the product is divisible by $k$, i.e. adds $+1$ to the answer; the number of such elements is $\\Bigl\\lfloor\\dfrac{n}{k}\\Bigr\\rfloor$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, every $k^2$-th element is divisible by $k^2$, i.e. adds another $+1$ to the answer (the first power of $k$ has already been counted in the previous paragraph). The number of such elements is $\\Bigl\\lfloor\\dfrac{n}{k^2}\\Bigr\\rfloor$.\n",
    "\n",
    "And so on, for every $i$ each $k^i$-th element adds another $+1$ to the answer, and there are $\\Bigl\\lfloor\\dfrac{n}{k^i}\\Bigr\\rfloor$ such elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final answer is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Bigl\\lfloor\\dfrac{n}{k}\\Bigr\\rfloor + \\Bigl\\lfloor\\dfrac{n}{k^2}\\Bigr\\rfloor + \\ldots + \\Bigl\\lfloor\\dfrac{n}{k^i}\\Bigr\\rfloor + \\ldots$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The sum is of course finite, since only approximately the first $\\log_k n$ elements are not zeros. Thus, the runtime of this algorithm is $O(\\log_k n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "\n",
    "int fact_pow (int n, int k) {\n",
    "\tint res = 0;\n",
    "\twhile (n) {\n",
    "\t\tn /= k;\n",
    "\t\tres += n;\n",
    "\t}\n",
    "\treturn res;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",

    "## Composite $k$\n",
    "\n",
    "The same idea can't be applied directly. Instead we can factor $k$, representing it as $k = k_1^{p_1} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot k_m^{p_m}$. For each $k_i$, we find the number of times it is present in $n!$ using the algorithm described above - let's call this value $a_i$. The answer for composite $k$ will be\n",
