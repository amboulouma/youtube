    "# Number of divisors / sum of divisors\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article we discuss how to compute the number of divisors $d(n)$ and the sum of divisors $\\sigma(n)$ of a given number $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Number of divisors\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be obvious that the prime factorization of a divisor $d$ has to be a subset of the prime factorization of $n$, e.g. $6 = 2 \\cdot 3$ is a divisor of $60 = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5$.\n",
    "So we only need to find all different subsets of the prime factorization of $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually the number of subsets is $2^x$ for a set with $x$ elements.\n",
    "However this is no longer true, if there are repeated elements in the set. In our case some prime factors may appear multiple times in the prime factorization of $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a prime factor $p$ appears $e$ times in the prime factorization of $n$, then we can use the factor $p$ up to $e$ times in the subset.\n",
    "Which means we have $e+1$ choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore if the prime factorization of $n$ is $p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_k^{e_k}$, where $p_i$ are distinct prime numbers, then the number of divisors is:\n",
    "$$d(n) = (e_1 + 1) \\cdot (e_2 + 1) \\cdots (e_k + 1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A way of thinking about it is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If there is only one distinct prime divisor $n = p_1^{e_1}$, then there are obviously $e_1 + 1$ divisors ($1, p_1, p_1^2, \\dots, p_1^{e_1}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "* If there are two distinct prime divisors $n = p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^{e_2}$, then you can arrange all divisors in form of a tabular.\n",
    "$$\\begin{array}{c|ccccc}\n",
    "& 1 & p_2 & p_2^2 & \\dots & p_2^{e_2} \\\\\\\\\n",
    "\\hline\n",
    "1 & 1 & p_2 & p_2^2 & \\dots & p_2^{e_2} \\\\\\\\\n",
    "p_1 & p_1 & p_1 \\cdot p_2 & p_1 \\cdot p_2^2 & \\dots & p_1 \\cdot p_2^{e_2} \\\\\\\\\n",
    "p_1^2 & p_1^2 & p_1^2 \\cdot p_2 & p_1^2 \\cdot p_2^2 & \\dots & p_1^2 \\cdot p_2^{e_2} \\\\\\\\\n",
    "\\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\\\\\n",
    "p_1^{e_1} & p_1^{e_1} & p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2 & p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^2 & \\dots & p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^{e_2} \\\\\\\\\n",
    "\\end{array}$$\n",
    "  So the number of divisors is trivially $(e_1 + 1) \\cdot (e_2 + 1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A similar argument can be made if there are more then two distinct prime factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sum of divisors\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the same argument of the previous section.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If there is only one distinct prime divisor $n = p_1^{e_1}$, then the sum is:\n",
    "  $$1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \\dots + p_1^{e_1} = \\frac{p_1^{e_1 + 1} - 1}{p_1 - 1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* If there are two distinct prime divisors $n = p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^{e_2}$, then we can make the same table as before.\n",
    "  The only difference is that now we now want to compute the sum instead of counting the elements.\n",
    "  It is easy to see, that the sum of each combination can be expressed as:\n",
    "  $$\\left(1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \\dots + p_1^{e_1}\\right) \\cdot \\left(1 + p_2 + p_2^2 + \\dots + p_2^{e_2}\\right)$$\n",
    "  $$ = \\frac{p_1^{e_1 + 1} - 1}{p_1 - 1} \\cdot \\frac{p_2^{e_2 + 1} - 1}{p_2 - 1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* In general, for $n = p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_k^{e_k}$ we receive the formula:\n",
    "  $$\\sigma(n) = \\frac{p_1^{e_1 + 1} - 1}{p_1 - 1} \\cdot \\frac{p_2^{e_2 + 1} - 1}{p_2 - 1} \\cdots \\frac{p_k^{e_k + 1} - 1}{p_k - 1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multiplicative functions\n",
    "\n",
    "A multiplicative function is a function $f(x)$ which satisfies\n",
    "$$f(a \\cdot b) = f(a) \\cdot f(b)$$\n",
    "if $a$ and $b$ are coprime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both $d(n)$ and $\\sigma(n)$ are multiplicative functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplicative functions have a huge variety of interesting properties, which can be very useful in number theory problems.\n",
    "For instance the Dirichlet convolution of two multiplicative functions is also multiplicative.\n",
