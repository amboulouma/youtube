    "\n",
    "This is easy to do if we go through all edges and add trapezoid areas bounded by each edge and x-axis. The area needs to be taken with sign so that the extra area will be reduced. Hence, the formula is as follows:\n",

    "$$A = \\sum_{(p,q)\\in \\text{edges}} \\frac{(p_x - q_x) \\cdot (p_y + q_y)}{2}$$\n",
