    "# Delaunay triangulation and Voronoi diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a set $\\\\{p_i\\\\}$ of points on the plane.\n",
    "A **Voronoi diagram** $V(\\\\{p_i\\\\})$ of $\\\\{p_i\\\\}$ is a partition of the plane into $n$ regions $V_i$, where $V_i = \\\\{p\\in\\mathbb{R}^2;\\ \\rho(p, p_i) = \\min\\ \\rho(p, p_k)\\\\}$.\n",
    "The cells of the Voronoi diagram are polygons (possibly infinite).\n",
    "A **Delaunay triangulation** $D(\\\\{p_i\\\\})$ of $\\\\{p_i\\\\}$ is a triangulation where every point $p_i$ is outside or on the boundary of the circumcircle of each triangle $T \\in D(\\\\{p_i\\\\})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a nasty degenerated case when the Voronoi diagram isn't connected and Delaunay triangulation doesn't exist. This case is when all points are collinear.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "The Delaunay triangulation maximizes the minimum angle among all possible triangulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Minimum Euclidean spanning tree of a point set is a subset of edges of its' Delaunay triangulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Duality\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that $\\\\{p_i\\\\}$ is not collinear and among $\\\\{p_i\\\\}$ no four points lie on one circle. Then $V(\\\\{p_i\\\\})$ and $D(\\\\{p_i\\\\})$ are dual, so if we obtain one of them, we may obtain the other in $O(n)$. What to do if it's not the case? The collinear case may be processed easily. Otherwise, $V$ and $D'$ are dual, where $D'$ is obtained from $D$ by removing all the edges such that two triangles on this edge share the circumcircle.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building Delaunay and Voronoi\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the duality, we only need a fast algorithm to compute only one of $V$ and $D$. We will describe how to build $D(\\\\{p_i\\\\})$ in $O(n\\log n)$. The triangulation will be built via divide-and-conquer algorithm due to Guibas and Stolfi.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quad-edge data structure\n",
    "\n",
    "During the algorithm $D$ will be stored inside the quad-edge data structure. This structure is described in the picture:\n",
    "<center>![Quad-Edge](&imgroot&/quad-edge.png)</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the algorithm we will use the following functions on edges:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. `make_edge(a, b)`<br>\n",
    "    This function creates an isolated edge from point `a` to point `b` together with its' reverse edge and both dual edges.\n",
    "  2. `splice(a, b)`<br>\n",
    "    This is a key function of the algorithm. It swaps `a->Onext` with `b->Onext` and `a->Onext->Rot->Onext` with `b->Onext->Rot->Onext`.\n",
    "  3. `delete_edge(e)`<br>\n",
    "    This function deletes e from the triangulation. To delete `e`, we may simply call `splice(e, e->Oprev)` and `splice(e->Rev, e->Rev->Oprev)`.\n",
    "  4. `connect(a, b)`<br>\n",
    "    This function creates a new edge `e` from `a->Dest` to `b->Org` in such a way that `a`, `b`, `e` all have the same left face. To do this, we call `e = make_edge(a->Dest, b->Org)`, `splice(e, a->Lnext)` and `splice(e->Rev, b)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm will compute the triangulation and return two quad-edges: the counterclockwise convex hull edge out of the leftmost vertex and the clockwise convex hull edge out of the rightmost vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's sort all points by x, and if $x_1 = x_2$ then by y. Let's solve the problem for some segment $(l, r)$ (initially $(l, r) = (0, n - 1)$). If $r - l + 1 = 2$, we will add an edge $(p[l], p[r])$ and return. If $r - l + 1 = 3$, we will firstly add the edges $(p[l], p[l + 1])$ and $(p[l + 1], p[r])$. We must also connect them using `splice(a->Rev, b)`. Now we must close the triangle. Our next action will depend on the orientation of $p[l], p[l + 1], p[r]$. If they are collinear, we can't make a triangle, so we simply return `(a, b->Rev)`. Otherwise, we create a new edge `c` by calling `connect(b, a)`. If the points are oriented counter-clockwise, we return `(a, b->Rev)`. Otherwise we return `(c->Rev, c)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now suppose that $r - l + 1 \\ge 4$. Firstly, let's solve $L = (l, \\frac{l + r}{2})$ and $R = (\\frac{l + r}{2} + 1, r)$ recursively. Now we have to merge these triangulations into one triangulation. Note that our points are sorted, so while merging we will add edges from L to R (so-called _cross_ edges) and remove some edges from L to L and from R to R.\n",
    "What is the structure of the cross edges? All these edges must cross a line parallel to the y-axis and placed at the splitting x value. This establishes a linear ordering of the cross edges, so we can talk about successive cross edges, the bottom-most cross edge, etc. The algorithm will add the cross edges in ascending order. Note that any two adjacent cross edges will have a common endpoint, and the third side of the triangle they define goes from L to L or from R to R. Let's call the current cross edge the base. The successor of the base will either go from the left endpoint of the base to one of the R-neighbors of the right endpoint or vice versa.\n",
    "Consider the circumcircle of base and the previous cross edge.\n",
    "Suppose this circle is transformed into other circles having base as a chord but lying further into the Oy direction.\n",
    "Our circle will go up for a while, but unless base is an upper tangent of L and R we will encounter a point belonging either to L or to R giving rise to a new triangle without any points in the circumcircle.\n",
    "The new L-R edge of this triangle is the next cross edge added.\n",
    "To do this efficiently, we compute two edges `lcand` and `rcand` so that `lcand` points to the first L point encountered in this process, and `rcand` points to the first R point.\n",
    "Then we choose the one that would be encountered first. Initially base points to the lower tangent of L and R.\n",
