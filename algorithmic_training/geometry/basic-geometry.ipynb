    "The dot (or scalar) product $\\mathbf a \\cdot \\mathbf b$ for vectors $\\mathbf a$ and $\\mathbf b$ can be defined in two identical ways.\n",

    "As you may see from the image below this projection is nothing but $|\\mathbf a| \\cos \\theta$ where $\\theta$ is the angle between $\\mathbf a$ and $\\mathbf b$. Thus $\\mathbf a\\cdot  \\mathbf b = |\\mathbf a| \\cos \\theta \\cdot |\\mathbf b|$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Dot_Product.svg/300px-Dot_Product.svg.png)</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The dot product holds some notable properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $\\mathbf a \\cdot \\mathbf b = \\mathbf b \\cdot \\mathbf a$\n",
    "2. $(\\alpha \\cdot \\mathbf a)\\cdot \\mathbf b = \\alpha \\cdot (\\mathbf a \\cdot \\mathbf b)$\n",
    "3. $(\\mathbf a + \\mathbf b)\\cdot \\mathbf c = \\mathbf a \\cdot \\mathbf c + \\mathbf b \\cdot \\mathbf c$\n",
    "\n",
    "I.e. it is a commutative function which is linear with respect to both arguments.\n",
    "Let's denote the unit vectors as\n",
    "$$\\mathbf e_x = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\\\ 0 \\\\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\mathbf e_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\\\ 1 \\\\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\mathbf e_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\\\ 0 \\\\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}.$$\n",
    "With this notation we can write the vector $\\mathbf r = (x;y;z)$ as $r = x \\cdot \\mathbf e_x + y \\cdot \\mathbf e_y + z \\cdot \\mathbf e_z$.\n",
    "And since for unit vectors \n",
    "$$\\mathbf e_x\\cdot \\mathbf e_x = \\mathbf e_y\\cdot \\mathbf e_y = \\mathbf e_z\\cdot \\mathbf e_z = 1,\\\\\\\n",
    "\\mathbf e_x\\cdot \\mathbf e_y = \\mathbf e_y\\cdot \\mathbf e_z = \\mathbf e_z\\cdot \\mathbf e_x = 0$$\n",
    "we can see that in terms of coordinates for $\\mathbf a = (x_1;y_1;z_1)$ and $\\mathbf b = (x_2;y_2;z_2)$ holds\n",
    "$$\\mathbf a\\cdot \\mathbf b = (x_1 \\cdot \\mathbf e_x + y_1 \\cdot\\mathbf e_y + z_1 \\cdot\\mathbf e_z)\\cdot( x_2 \\cdot\\mathbf e_x + y_2 \\cdot\\mathbf e_y + z_2 \\cdot\\mathbf e_z) = x_1 x_2 + y_1 y_2 + z_1 z_2$$\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When solving problems one should use algebraic definition to calculate dot products, but keep in mind geometric definition and properties to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "We can define many geometrical properties via the dot product.\n",
    "For example \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Norm of $\\mathbf a$ (squared length): $|\\mathbf a|^2 = \\mathbf a\\cdot \\mathbf a$\n",
    "2. Length of $\\mathbf a$: $|\\mathbf a| = \\sqrt{\\mathbf a\\cdot \\mathbf a}$\n",
    "3. Projection of $\\mathbf a$ onto $\\mathbf b$: $\\dfrac{\\mathbf a\\cdot\\mathbf b}{|\\mathbf b|}$\n",
    "4. Angle between vectors: $\\arccos \\left(\\dfrac{\\mathbf a\\cdot \\mathbf b}{|\\mathbf a| \\cdot |\\mathbf b|}\\right)$\n",
    "5. From the previous point we may see that the dot product is positive if the angle between them is acute, negative if it is obtuse and it equals zero if they are orthogonal, i.e. they form a right angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that all these functions do not depend on the number of dimensions, hence they will be the same for the 2D and 3D case:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp dotproperties\n",
    "ftype norm(point2d a) {\n",
    "    return dot(a, a);\n",
    "}\n",
    "double abs(point2d a) {\n",
    "    return sqrt(norm(a));\n",
    "}\n",
    "double proj(point2d a, point2d b) {\n",
    "    return dot(a, b) / abs(b);\n",
    "}\n",
    "double angle(point2d a, point2d b) {\n",
    "    return acos(dot(a, b) / abs(a) / abs(b));\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To see the next important property we should take a look at the set of points $\\mathbf r$ for which $\\mathbf r\\cdot \\mathbf a = C$ for some fixed constant $C$.\n",
    "You can see that this set of points is exactly the set of points for which the projection onto $\\mathbf a$ is the point $C \\cdot \\dfrac{\\mathbf a}{|\\mathbf a|}$ and they form a hyperplane orthogonal to $\\mathbf a$.\n",
    "You can see the vector $\\mathbf a$ alongside with several such vectors having same dot product with it in 2D on the picture below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>![Vectors having same dot product with a](https://i.imgur.com/eyO7St4.png)</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2D these vectors will form a line, in 3D they will form a plane.\n",
    "Note that this result allows us to define a line in 2D as $\\mathbf r\\cdot \\mathbf n=C$ or $(\\mathbf r - \\mathbf r_0)\\cdot \\mathbf n=0$ where $\\mathbf n$ is vector orthogonal to the line and $\\mathbf r_0$ is any vector already present on the line and $C = \\mathbf r_0\\cdot \\mathbf n$.\n",
    "In the same manner a plane can be defined in 3D.\n",

    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume you have three vectors $\\mathbf a$, $\\mathbf b$ and $\\mathbf c$ in 3D space joined in a parallelepiped as in the picture below:\n",

    "\n",
    "How would you calculate its volume?\n",
    "From school we know that we should multiply the area of the base with the height, which is projection of $\\mathbf a$ onto direction orthogonal to base.\n",
    "That means that if we define $\\mathbf b \\times \\mathbf c$ as the vector which is orthogonal to both $\\mathbf b$ and $\\mathbf c$ and which length is equal to the area of the parallelogram formed by $\\mathbf b$ and $\\mathbf c$ then $|\\mathbf a\\cdot (\\mathbf b\\times\\mathbf c)|$ will be equal to the volume of the parallelepiped.\n",
    "For integrity we will say that $\\mathbf b\\times \\mathbf c$ will be always directed in such way that the rotation from the vector $\\mathbf b$ to the vector $\\mathbf c$ from the point of $\\mathbf b\\times \\mathbf c$ is always counter-clockwise (see the picture below).\n",

    "\n",
    "Some notable properties of cross and triple products:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $\\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf b = -\\mathbf b\\times \\mathbf a$\n",
    "2. $(\\alpha \\cdot \\mathbf a)\\times \\mathbf b = \\alpha \\cdot (\\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf b)$\n",
    "3. For any $\\mathbf b$ and $\\mathbf c$ there is exactly one vector $\\mathbf r$ such that $\\mathbf a\\cdot (\\mathbf b\\times \\mathbf c) = \\mathbf a\\cdot\\mathbf r$ for any vector $\\mathbf a$. <br>Indeed if there are two such vectors $\\mathbf r_1$ and $\\mathbf r_2$ then $\\mathbf a\\cdot (\\mathbf r_1 - \\mathbf r_2)=0$ for all vectors $\\mathbf a$ which is possible only when $\\mathbf r_1 = \\mathbf r_2$.\n",
    "4. $\\mathbf a\\cdot (\\mathbf b\\times \\mathbf c) = \\mathbf b\\cdot (\\mathbf c\\times \\mathbf a) = -\\mathbf a\\cdot( \\mathbf c\\times \\mathbf b)$\n",
    "5. $(\\mathbf a + \\mathbf b)\\times \\mathbf c = \\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf c + \\mathbf b\\times \\mathbf c$.\n",
    "Indeed for all vectors $\\mathbf r$ the chain of equations holds:\n",
    "$$\\mathbf r\\cdot( (\\mathbf a + \\mathbf b)\\times \\mathbf c) = (\\mathbf a + \\mathbf b) \\cdot (\\mathbf c\\times \\mathbf r) =  \\mathbf a \\cdot(\\mathbf c\\times \\mathbf r) + \\mathbf b\\cdot(\\mathbf c\\times \\mathbf r) = \\mathbf r\\cdot (\\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf c) + \\mathbf r\\cdot(\\mathbf b\\times \\mathbf c) = \\mathbf r\\cdot(\\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf c + \\mathbf b\\times \\mathbf c)$$\n",
    "Which proves $(\\mathbf a + \\mathbf b)\\times \\mathbf c = \\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf c + \\mathbf b\\times \\mathbf c$ due to point 3.\n",
    "6. $|\\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf b|=|\\mathbf a| \\cdot |\\mathbf b| \\sin \\theta$ where $\\theta$ is angle between $\\mathbf a$ and $\\mathbf b$, since $|\\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf b|$ equals to the area of the parallelogram formed by $\\mathbf a$ and $\\mathbf b$. \n",

    "### Line intersection\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many possible ways to define a line in 2D and you shouldn't hesitate to combine them.\n",

    "Instead of thinking on geometric approach, you can work out an algebraic one which can be obtained immediately.\n",
