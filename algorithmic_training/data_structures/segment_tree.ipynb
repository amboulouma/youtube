    "# Segment Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "A Segment Tree is a data structure that allows answering range queries over an array effectively, while still being flexible enough to allow modifying the array. \n",
    "This includes finding the sum of consecutive array elements $a[l \\dots r]$, or finding the minimum element in a such a range in $O(\\log n)$ time. \n",
    "Between answering such queries the Segment Tree allows modifying the array by replacing one element, or even change the elements of a whole subsegment (e.g. assigning all elements $a[l \\dots r]$ to any value, or adding a value to all element in the subsegment). \n",
    "\n",
    "In general a Segment Tree is a very flexible data structure, and a huge number of problems can be solved with it. \n",
    "Additionally it is also possible to apply more complex operations and answer more complex queries (see [Advanced versions of Segment Trees](data_structures/segment_tree.html#advanced-versions-of-segment-trees)).\n",
    "In particular the Segment Tree can be easily generalized to larger dimensions. \n",
    "For instance with a two-dimensional Segment Tree you can answer sum or minimum queries over some subrectangle of a given matrix.\n",
    "However only in $O(\\log^2 n)$ time. \n",
    "\n",
    "One important property of Segment Trees is, that they require only a linear amount of memory.\n",
    "The standard Segment Tree requires $4n$ vertices for working on an array of size $n$. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Simplest form of a Segment Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "To start easy, we consider the simplest form of a Segment Tree. \n",
    "We want to answer sum queries efficiently. \n",
    "The formal definition of our task is:\n",
    "We have an array $a[0 \\dots n-1]$, and the Segment Tree must be able to find the sum of elements between the indices $l$ and $r$ (i.e. computing the sum $\\sum_{i=l}^r a[i]$), and also handle changing values of the elements in the array (i.e. perform assignments of the form $a[i] = x$). \n",
    "The Segment Tree should be able to process both queries in $O(\\log n)$ time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure of the Segment Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what is a Segment Tree?\n",
    "\n",
    "We compute and store the sum of the elements of the whole array, i.e. the sum of the segment $a[0 \\dots n-1]$. \n",
    "We then split the array into two halves $a[0 \\dots n/2]$ and $a[n/2+1 \\dots n-1]$ and compute the sum of each halve and store them. \n",
    "Each of these two halves in turn also split in half, their sums are computed and stored. \n",
    "And this process repeats until all segments reach size $1$. \n",
    "In other words we start with the segment $a[0 \\dots n-1]$, split the current segment in half (if it has not yet become a segment containing a single element), and then calling the same procedure for both halves. \n",
    "For each such segment we store the sum of the numbers on it. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can say, that these segments form a binary tree: \n",
    "the root of this tree is the segment $a[0 \\dots n-1]$, and each vertex (except leaf vertices) has exactly two child vertices. \n",
    "This is why the data structure is called \"Segment Tree\", even though in most implementations the tree is not constructed explicitly (see [Implementation](#implementation)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a visual representation of such a Segment Tree over the array $a = [1, 3, -2, 8, -7]$:\n",
    "\n",
    "![\"Sum Segment Tree\"](&imgroot&/sum-segment-tree.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "From this short description of the data structure, we can already conclude that a Segment Tree only requires a linear number of vertices. \n",
    "The first level of the tree contains a single node (the root), the second level will contain two vertices, in the third it will contain four vertices, until the number of vertices reaches $n$. \n",
    "Thus the number of vertices in the worst case can be estimated by the sum $1 + 2 + 4 + \\dots + 2^{\\lceil\\log_2 n\\rceil} = 2^{\\lceil\\log_2 n\\rceil + 1} \\lt 4n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that whenever $n$ is not a power of two, not all levels of the Segment Tree will be completely filled. \n",
    "We can see that behavior in the image.\n",
    "For now we can forget about this fact, but it will become important later during the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The height of the Segment Tree is $O(\\log n)$, because when going down from the root to the leaves the size of the segments decreases approximately by half. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Construction\n",
    "\n",
    "Before constructing the segment tree, we need to decide:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the *value* that gets stored at each node of the segment tree.\n",
    "   For example, in a sum segment tree, a node would store the sum of the elements in its range $[l, r]$.\n",
    "2. the *merge* operation that merges two siblings in a segment tree.\n",
    "   For example, in a sum segment tree, the two nodes corresponding to the ranges $a[l_1 \\dots r_1]$ and $a[l_2 \\dots r_2]$ would be merged into a node corresponding to the range $a[l_1 \\dots r_2]$ by adding the values of the two nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that a vertex is a \"leaf vertex\", if its corresponding segment covers only one value in the original array. It is present at the lowermost level of a segment tree. Its value would be equal to the (corresponding) element $a[i]$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, for construction of the segment tree, we start at the bottom level (the leaf vertices) and assign them their respective values. On the basis of these values, we can compute the values of the previous level, using the `merge` function.\n",
    "And on the basis of those, we can compute the values of the previous, and repeat the procedure until we reach the root vertex. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is convenient to describe this operation recursively in the other direction, i.e., from the root vertex to the leaf vertices. The construction procedure, if called on a non-leaf vertex, does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. recursively construct the values of the two child vertices\n",
    "2. merge the computed values of these children.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start the construction at the root vertex, and hence, we are able to compute the entire segment tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity of this construction is $O(n)$, assuming that the merge operation is constant time (the merge operation gets called $n$ times, which is equal to the number of internal nodes in the segment tree).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sum queries\n",
    "\n",
    "For now we are going to answer sum queries. As an input we receive two integers $l$ and $r$, and we have to compute the sum of the segment $a[l \\dots r]$ in $O(\\log n)$ time. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we will traverse the Segment Tree and use the precomputed sums of the segments.\n",
    "Let's assume that we are currently at the vertex that covers the segment $a[tl \\dots tr]$.\n",
    "There are three possible cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest case is when the segment $a[l \\dots r]$ is equal to the corresponding segment of the current vertex (i.e. $a[l \\dots r] = a[tl \\dots tr]$), then we are finished and can return the precomputed sum that is stored in the vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively the segment of the query can fall completely into the domain of either the left or the right child.\n",
    "Recall that the left child covers the segment $a[tl \\dots tm]$ and the right vertex covers the segment $a[tm + 1 \\dots tr]$ with $tm = (tl + tr) / 2$. \n",
    "In this case we can simply go to the child vertex, which corresponding segment covers the query segment, and execute the algorithm described here with that vertex. \n",
    "\n",
    "And then there is the last case, the query segment intersects with both children. \n",
    "In this case we have no other option as to make two recursive calls, one for each child.\n",
    "First we go to the left child, compute a partial answer for this vertex (i.e. the sum of values of the intersection between the segment of the query and the segment of the left child), then go to the right child, compute the partial answer using that vertex, and then combine the answers by adding them. \n",
    "In other words, since the left child represents the segment $a[tl \\dots tm]$ and the right child the segment $a[tm+1 \\dots tr]$, we compute the sum query $a[l \\dots tm]$ using the left child, and the sum query $a[tm+1 \\dots r]$ using the right child. \n",
    "\n",
    "So processing a sum query is a function that recursively calls itself once with either the left or the right child (without changing the query boundaries), or twice, once for the left and once for the right child (by splitting the query into two subqueries). \n",
    "And the recursion ends, whenever the boundaries of the current query segment coincides with the boundaries of the segment of the current vertex. \n",
    "In that case the answer will be the precomputed value of the sum of this segment, which is stored in the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the calculation of the query is a traversal of the tree, which spreads through all necessary branches of the tree, and uses the precomputed sum values of the segments in the tree. \n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously we will start the traversal from the root vertex of the Segment Tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure is illustrated in the following image.\n",
    "Again the array $a = [1, 3, -2, 8, -7]$ is used, and here we want to compute the sum $\\sum_{i=2}^4 a[i]$.\n",
    "The colored vertices will be visited, and we will use the precomputed values of the green vertices.\n",
    "This gives us the result $-2 + 1 = -1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "![\"Sum Segment Tree Query\"](&imgroot&/sum-segment-tree-query.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is the complexity of this algorithm $O(\\log n)$?\n",
    "To show this complexity we look at each level of the tree. \n",
    "It turns out, that for each level we only visit not more than four vertices. \n",
    "And since the height of the tree is $O(\\log n)$, we receive the desired running time. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can show that this proposition (at most four vertices each level) is true by induction.\n",
    "At the first level, we only visit one vertex, the root vertex, so here we visit less than four vertices. \n",
    "Now let's look at an arbitrary level.\n",
    "By induction hypothesis, we visit at most four vertices. \n",
    "If we only visit at most two vertices, the next level has at most four vertices. That trivial, because each vertex can only cause at most two recursive calls. \n",
    "So let's assume that we visit three or four vertices in the current level. \n",
    "From those vertices, we will analyze the vertices in the middle more carefully. \n",
    "Since the sum query asks for the sum of a continuous subarray, we know that segments corresponding to the visited vertices in the middle will be completely covered by the segment of the sum query. \n",
    "Therefore these vertices will not make any recursive calls. \n",
    "So only the most left, and the most right vertex will have the potential to make recursive calls. \n",
    "And those will only create at most four recursive calls, so also the next level will satisfy the assertion.\n",
    "We can say that one branch approaches the left boundary of the query, and the second branch approaches the right one. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore we visit at most $4 \\log n$ vertices in total, and that is equal to a running time of $O(\\log n)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion the query works by dividing the input segment into several sub-segments for which all the sums are already precomputed and stored in the tree. \n",
    "And if we stop partitioning whenever the query segment coincides with the vertex segment, then we only need $O(\\log n)$ such segments, which gives the effectiveness of the Segment Tree. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Update queries\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we want to modify a specific element in the array, let's say we want to do the assignment $a[i] = x$. \n",
    "And we have to rebuild the Segment Tree, such that it correspond to the new, modified array. \n",
    "\n",
    "This query is easier than the sum query. \n",
    "Each level of a Segment Tree forms a partition of the array. \n",
    "Therefore an element $a[i]$ only contributes to one segment from each level. \n",
    "Thus only $O(\\log n)$ vertices need to be updated. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy to see, that the update request can be implemented using a recursive function. \n",
    "The function gets passed the current tree vertex, and it recursively calls itself with one of the two child vertices (the one that contains $a[i]$ in its segment), and after that recomputes its sum value, similar how it is done in the build method (that is as the sum of its two children). \n",
    "\n",
    "Again here is a visualization using the same array.\n",
    "Here we perform the update $a[2] = 3$.\n",
    "The green vertices are the vertices that we visit and update.\n",
    "\n",
    "![\"Sum Segment Tree Update\"](&imgroot&/sum-segment-tree-update.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation ### {#implementation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The main consideration is how to store the Segment Tree.\n",
    "Of course we can define a $\\text{Vertex}$ struct and create objects, that store the boundaries of the segment, its sum and additionally also pointers to its child vertices.\n",
    "However this requires storing a lot of redundant information.\n",
    "We will use a simple trick, to make this a lot more efficient. \n",
    "We only store the sums in an array.\n",
    "The sum of the root vertex at index 1, the sums of its two child vertices at indices 2 and 3, the sums of the children of those two vertices at indices 4 to 7, and so on. \n",
    "It is easy to see, that the left child of a vertex at index $i$ is stored at index $2i$, and the right one at index $2i + 1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This simplifies the implementation a lot. \n",
    "We don't need to store the structure of the tree in memory. \n",
    "It is defined implicitly. \n",
    "We only need one array which contains the sums of all segments. \n",
    "\n",
    "As noted before, we need to store at most $4n$ vertices.\n",
    "It might be less, but for convenience we always allocate an array of size $4n$.\n",
    "There will be some elements in the sum array, that will not correspond to any vertices in the actual tree, but this doesn't complicate the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we store the Segment Tree simply as an array $t[]$ with a size of four times the input size $n$:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp segment_tree_implementation_definition\n",
    "int n, t[4*MAXN];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure for constructing the Segment Tree from a given array $a[]$ looks like this: \n",
    "it is a recursive function with the parameters $a[]$ (the input array), $v$ (the index of the current vertex), and the boundaries $tl$ and $tr$ of the current segment. \n",
    "In the main program this function will be called with the parameters of the root vertex: $v = 1$, $tl = 0$, and $tr = n - 1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp segment_tree_implementation_build\n",

    "Further the function for answering sum queries is also a recursive function, which receives as parameters information about the current vertex/segment (i.e. the index $v$ and the boundaries $tl$ and $tr$) and also the information about the boundaries of the query, $l$ and $r$. \n",
    "In order to simplify the code, this function always does two recursive calls, even if only one is necessary - in that case the superfluous recursive call will have $l > r$, and this can easily be caught using an additional check at the beginning of the function.\n",

    "### Memory efficient implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people use the implementation from the previous section. If you look at the array `t` you can see that it follows the numbering of the tree nodes in the order of a BFS traversal (level-order traversal). \n",
    "Using this traversal the children of vertex $v$ are $2v$ and $2v + 1$ respectively.\n",
    "However if $n$ is not a power of two, this method will skip some indices and leave some parts of the array `t` unused.\n",
    "The memory consumption is limited by $4n$, even though a Segment Tree of an array of $n$ elements requires only $2n - 1$ vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "However it can be reduced. \n",
    "We renumber the vertices of the tree in the order of an Euler tour traversal (pre-order traversal), and we write all these vertices next to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets look at a vertex at index $v$, and let him be responsible for the segment $[l, r]$, and let $mid = \\dfrac{l + r}{2}$.\n",
    "It is obvious that the left child will have the index $v + 1$.\n",
    "The left child is responsible for the segment $[l, mid]$, i.e. in total there will be $2 * (mid - l + 1) - 1$ vertices in the left child's subtree.\n",
    "Thus we can compute the index of the right child of $v$. The index will be $v + 2 * (mid - l + 1)$.\n",

    "We have the same problem statement, we want to find the minimal number greater than or equal to $x$ in a segment, but this time in $O(\\log n)$ time.\n",
    "We will improve the time complexity using the technique \"fractional cascading\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Fractional cascading is a simple technique that allows you to improve the running time of multiple binary searches, which are conducted at the same time. \n",
    "Our previous approach to the search query was, that we divide the task into several subtasks, each of which is solved with a binary search. \n",
    "Fractional cascading allows you to replace all of these binary searches with a single one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest and most obvious example of fractional cascading is the following problem:\n",
    "there are $k$ sorted lists of numbers, and we must find in each list the first number greater than or equal to the given number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of performing a binary search for each list, we could merge all lists into one big sorted list.\n",
    "Additionally for each element $y$ we store a list of results of searching for $y$ in each of the $k$ lists.\n",
    "Therefore if we want to find the smallest number greater than or equal to $x$, we just need to perform one single binary search, and from the list of indices we can determine the smallest number in each list.\n",
    "This approach however requires $O(n \\cdot k)$ ($n$ is the length of the combined lists), which can be quite inefficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fractional cascading reduces this memory complexity to $O(n)$ memory, by creating from the $k$ input lists $k$ new lists, in which each list contains the corresponding list and additionally also every second element of the following new list.\n",
    "Using this structure it is only necessary to store two indices, the index of the element in the original list, and the index of the element in the following new list.\n",
    "So this approach only uses $O(n)$ memory, and still can answer the queries using a single binary search. \n",
    "\n",
    "But for our application we do not need the full power of fractional cascading.\n",
    "In our Segment Tree a vertex will contain the sorted list of all elements that occur in either the left or the right subtrees (like in the Merge Sort Tree). \n",
    "Additionally to this sorted list, we store two positions for each element.\n",
    "For an element $y$ we store the smallest index $i$, such that the $i$th element in the sorted list of the left child is greater or equal to $y$.\n",
    "And we store the smallest index $j$, such that the $j$th element in the sorted list of the right child is greater or equal to $y$.\n",
    "These values can be computed in parallel to the merging step when we build the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does this speed up the queries?\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, in the normal solution we did a binary search in ever node.\n",
    "But with this modification, we can avoid all except one.\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer a query, we simply to a binary search in the root node.\n",
    "This gives as the smallest element $y \\ge x$ in the complete array, but it also gives us two positions.\n",
    "The index of the smallest element greater or equal $x$ in the left subtree, and the index of the smallest element $y$ in the right subtree. Notice that $\\ge y$ is the same as $\\ge x$, since our array doesn't contain any elements between $x$ and $y$.\n",
    "In the normal Merge Sort Tree solution we would compute these indices via binary search, but with the help of the precomputed values we can just look them up in $O(1)$.\n",
    "And we can repeat that until we visited all nodes that cover our query interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, as usual we touch $O(\\log n)$ nodes during a query. In the root node we do a binary search, and in all other nodes we only do constant work.\n",
    "This means the complexity for answering a query is $O(\\log n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "But notice, that this uses three times more memory than a normal Merge Sort Tree, which already uses a lot of memory ($O(n \\log n)$).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is straightforward to apply this technique to a problem, that doesn't require any modification queries.\n",
    "The two positions are just integers and can easily be computed by counting when merging the two sorted sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "It it still possible to also allow modification queries, but that complicates the entire code.\n",
    "Instead of integers, you need to store the sorted array as `multiset`, and instead of indices you need to store iterators.\n",
    "And you need to work very carefully, so that you increment or decrement the correct iterators during a modification query.\n",

    "It is clear that in the case of such a problem it becomes unreasonably wasteful to construct a two-dimensional Segment Tree with $O(n^2)$ elements.\n",

    "\n",
    "So we proceed as follows:\n",
    "at each vertex of the Segment Tree with respect to the first coordinate we store a Segment Tree constructed only by those second coordinates that occur in the current segment of the first coordinates. \n",
    "In other words, when constructing a Segment Tree inside some vertex with index $vx$ and the boundaries $tlx$ and $trx$, we only consider those points that fall into this interval $x \\in [tlx, trx]$, and build a Segment Tree just using them.\n",

    "We still can answer the queries in $O(\\log^2 n)$ time, we just have to make a binary search on the second coordinate, but this will not worsen the complexity.\n",

    "in fact if a new point appears, we have to add a new element in the middle of some Segment Tree along the second coordinate, which cannot be effectively done.\n",

    "Segment Tree is a data structure that can be turned into a persistent data structure efficiently (both in time and memory consumption).\n",
    "We want to avoid copying the complete tree before each modification, and we don't want to loose the $O(\\log n)$ time behavior for answering range queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, any change request in the Segment Tree leads to a change in the data of only $O(\\log n)$ vertices along the path starting from the root. \n",
    "So if we store the Segment Tree using pointers (i.e. a vertex stores pointers to the left and the right child vertices), then when performing the modification query, we simply need to create new vertices instead of changing the available vertices.\n",
    "Vertices that are not affected by the modification query can still be used by pointing the pointers to the old vertices.\n",

    "\n",
    "We will use a Segment Tree that counts all appearing numbers, i.e. in the Segment Tree we will store the histogram of the array.\n",
    "So the leaf vertices will store how often the values $0$, $1$, $\\dots$, $n-1$ will appear in the array, and the other vertices store how many numbers in some range are in the array. \n",
    "In other words we create a regular Segment Tree with sum queries over the histogram of the array.\n",
    "But instead of creating all $n$ Segment Trees for every possible prefix, we will create one persistent one, that will contain the same information.\n",
    "We will start with an empty Segment Tree (all counts will be $0$) pointed to by $root_0$, and add the elements $a[1]$, $a[2]$, $\\dots$, $a[n]$ one after another.\n",

    "Using this Segment Tree we can find in $O(\\log n)$ time the position of the $k$-th element using the same technique discussed in [Counting the number of zeros, searching for the $k$-th zero](data_structures/segment_tree.html#counting-zero-search-kth).\n",

    "It is easy to see that such a Segment Tree is just the difference between the Segment Tree rooted at $root_{r}$ and the Segment Tree rooted at $root_{l-1}$, i.e. every vertex in the $[l \\dots r]$ Segment Tree can be computed with the vertex of the $root_{r}$ tree minus the vertex of the $root_{l-1}$ tree.\n",
