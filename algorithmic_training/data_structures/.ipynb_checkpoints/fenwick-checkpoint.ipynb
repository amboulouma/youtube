    "\n",
    "Let, $f$ be some _reversible_ function and $A$ be an array of integers of length $N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fenwick tree is a data structure which:\n",
    "\n",
    "* calculates the value of function $f$ in the given range $[l, r]$ (i.e. $f(A_l, A_{l+1}, \\dots, A_r)$) in $O(\\log n)$ time;\n",
    "* updates the value of an element of $A$ in $O(\\log n)$ time;\n",
    "* requires $O(N)$ memory, or in other words, exactly the same memory required for $A$;\n",
    "* is easy to use and code, especially, in the case of multidimensional arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fenwick tree is also called **Binary Indexed Tree**, or just **BIT** abbreviated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common application of Fenwick tree is _calculating the sum of a range_ (i.e. $f(A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_k) = A_1 + A_2 + \\dots + A_k$).\n",

    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of simplicity, we will assume that function $f$ is just a *sum function*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an array of integers $A[0 \\dots N-1]$.\n",
    "A Fenwick tree is just an array $T[0 \\dots N-1]$, where each of its elements is equal to the sum of elements of $A$ in some range $[g(i), i]$:\n",
    "$$T_i = \\sum_{j = g(i)}^{i}{A_j},$$\n",
    "where $g$ is some function that satisfies $0 \\le g(i) \\le i$.\n",
    "We will define the function in the next few paragraphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data structure is called tree, because there is a nice representation of the data structure as tree, although we don't need to model an actual tree with nodes and edges.\n",
    "We will only need to maintain the array $T$ to handle all queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The Fenwick tree presented here uses zero-based indexing.\n",
    "Many people will actually use a version of the Fenwick tree that uses one-based indexing.\n",
    "Therefore you will also find an alternative implementation using one-based indexing in the implementation section.\n",
    "Both versions are equivalent in terms of time and memory complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can write some pseudo-code for the two operations mentioned above - get the sum of elements of $A$ in the range $[0, r]$ and update (increase) some element $A_i$:"

    "The function `sum` works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. first, it adds the sum of the range $[g(r), r]$ (i.e. $T[r]$) to the `result`\n",
    "2. then, it \"jumps\" to the range $[g(g(r)-1), g(r)-1]$, and adds this range's sum to the `result`\n",
    "3. and so on, until it \"jumps\" from $[0, g(g( \\dots g(r)-1 \\dots -1)-1)]$ to $[g(-1), -1]$; that is where the `sum` function stops jumping.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `increase` works with the same analogy, but \"jumps\" in the direction of increasing indices:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. sums of the ranges $[g(j), j]$ that satisfy the condition $g(j) \\le i \\le j$ are increased by `delta` , that is `t[j] += delta`. Therefore we updated all elements in $T$ that corresponds to ranges in with $A_i$ lies.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is obvious that the complexity of both `sum` and `increase` depend on the function $g$.\n",
    "There are lots of ways to choose the function $g$, as long as $0 \\le g(i) \\le i$ for all $i$.\n",
    "For instance the function $g(i) = i$ works, which results just in $T = A$, and therefore summation queries are slow.\n",
    "We can also take the function $g(i) = 0$.\n",
    "This will correspond to prefix sum arrays, which means that finding the sum of the range $[0, i]$ will only take constant time, but updates are slow.\n",
    "The clever part of the Fenwick algorithm is, that there it uses a special definition of the function $g$ that can handle both operations in $O(\\log N)$ time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition of $g(i)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The computation of $g(i)$ is defined using the following simple operation:\n",
    "we replace all trailing $1$ bits in the binary representation of $i$ with $0$ bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, if the least significant digit of $i$ in binary is $0$, then $g(i) = i$.\n",
    "And otherwise the least significant digit is a $1$, and we take this $1$ and all other trailing $1$s and flip them.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance we get\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\n",
    "g(11) = g(1011_2) = 1000_2 &= 8 \\\\\\\\\n",

    "\n",
    "There exists a simple implementation using bitwise operations for the non-trivial operation described above:\n",
    "$$g(i) = i ~\\&~ (i+1),$$\n",
    "where $\\&$ is the bitwise AND operator. It is not hard to convince yourself that this solution does the same thing as the operation described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we just need to find a way to iterate over all $j$'s, such that $g(j) \\le i \\le j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy to see that we can find all such $j$'s by starting with $i$ and flipping the last unset bit.\n",
    "We will call this operation $h(j)$.\n",
    "For example, for $i = 10$ we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\n",
    "10 &= 0001010_2 \\\\\\\\\n",
    "h(10) = 11 &= 0001011_2 \\\\\\\\\n",
