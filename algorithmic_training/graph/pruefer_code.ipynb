    "# Prüfer code\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article we will look at the so-called **Prüfer code** (or Prüfer sequence), which is a way of encoding a labeled tree into a sequence of numbers in a unique way.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the help of the Prüfer code we will prove **Cayley's formula** (which specified the number of spanning trees in a complete graph).\n",
    "Also we show the solution to the problem of counting the number of ways of adding edges to a graph to make it connected.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**, we will not consider trees consisting of a single vertex - this is a special case in which multiple statements clash.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prüfer code\n",
    "\n",
    "The Prüfer code is a way of encoding a labeled tree with $n$ vertices using a sequence of $n - 2$ integers in the interval $[0; n-1]$.\n",
    "This encoding also acts as a **bijection** between all spanning trees of a complete graph and the numerical sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although using the Prüfer code for storing and operating on tree is impractical due the specification of the representation, the Prüfer codes are used frequently: mostly in solving combinatorial problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inventor - Heinz Prüfer - proposed this code in 1918 as a proof for Cayley's formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building the Prüfer code for a given tree\n",
    "\n",
    "The Prüfer code is constructed as follows.\n",
    "We will repeat the following procedure $n - 2$ times:\n",
    "we select the leaf of the tree with the smallest number, remove it from the tree, and write down the number of the vertex that was connected to it.\n",
    "After $n - 2$ iterations there will only remain $2$ vertices, and the algorithm ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the Prüfer code for a given tree is a sequence of $n - 2$ numbers, where each number is the number of the connected vertex, i.e. this number is in the interval $[0, n-1]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm for computing the Prüfer code can be implemented easily with $O(n \\log n)$ time complexity, simply by using a data structure to extract the minimum (for instance `set` or `priority_queue` in C++), which contains a list of all the current leafs.\n",

    "Such an approach is described in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building the Prüfer code for a given tree in linear time\n",
    "\n",
    "The essence of the algorithm is to use a **moving pointer**, which will always point to the current leaf vertex that we want to remove.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance this seems impossible, because during the process of constructing the Prüfer code the leaf number can increase and decrease.\n",
    "However after a closer look, this is actually not true.\n",
    "The number of leafs will not increase. Either the number decreases by one (we remove one leaf vertex and don't gain a new one), or it stay the same (we remove one leaf vertex and gain another one).\n",
    "In the first case there is no other way than searching for the next smallest leaf vertex.\n",
    "In the second case, however, we can decide in $O(1)$ time, if we can continue using the vertex that became a new leaf vertex, or if we have to search for the next smallest leaf vertex.\n",
    "And in quite a lot of times we can continue with the new leaf vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this we will use a variable $\\text{ptr}$, which will indicate that in the set of vertices between $0$ and $\\text{ptr}$ is at most one leaf vertex, namely the current one.\n",
    "All other vertices in that range are either already removed from the tree, or have still more than one adjacent vertices.\n",
    "At the same time we say, that we haven't removed any leaf vertices bigger than $\\text{ptr}$ yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "This variable is already very helpful in the first case.\n",
    "After removing the current leaf node, we know that there cannot be a leaf node between $0$ and $\\text{ptr}$, therefore we can start the search for the next one directly at $\\text{ptr} + 1$, and we don't have to start the search back at vertex $0$.\n",
    "And in the second case, we can further distinguish two cases:\n",
    "Either the newly gained leaf vertex is smaller than $\\text{ptr}$, then this must be the next leaf vertex, since we know that there are no other vertices smaller than $\\text{ptr}$.\n",
    "Or the newly gained leaf vertex is bigger.\n",
    "But then we also know that it has to be bigger than $\\text{ptr}$, and can start the search again at $\\text{ptr} + 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though we might have to perform multiple linear searches for the next leaf vertex, the pointer $\\text{ptr}$ only increases and therefore the time complexity in total is $O(n)$.\n",

    "### Restoring the tree using the Prüfer code\n",
    "\n",
    "To restore the tree it suffice to only focus on the property discussed in the last section.\n",
    "We already know the degree of all the vertices in the desired tree.\n",
    "Therefore we can find all leaf vertices, and also the first leaf that was removed in the first step (it has to be the smallest leaf).\n",
    "This leaf vertex was connected to the vertex corresponding to the number in the first cell of the Prüfer code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus we found the first edge removed by when then the Prüfer code was generated.\n",
    "We can add this edge to the answer and reduce the degrees at both ends of the edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will repeat this operation until we have used all numbers of the Prüfer code:\n",
    "we look for the minimum vertex with degree equal to $1$, connect it with the next vertex from the Prüfer code, and reduce the degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end we only have two vertices left with degree equal to $1$.\n",
    "These are the vertices that didn't got removed by the Prüfer code process.\n",
    "We connect them to get the last edge of the tree.\n",
    "One of them will always be the vertex $n-1$.\n",
    "\n",

    "The graph currently has $k$ components.\n",
    "We want to compute the number of ways of adding $k-1$ edges so that the graph becomes connected (obviously $k-1$ is the minimum number necessary to make the graph connected).\n",

    "Let us derive a formula for solving this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use $s_1, \\dots, s_k$ for the sizes of the connected components in the graph.\n",

    "Therefore it turns out that this problem is very similar to the search for the number of spanning trees of a complete graph with $k$ vertices.\n",
    "The only difference is that each vertex has actually the size $s_i$: each edge connecting the vertex $i$, actually multiplies the answer by $s_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus in order to calculate the number of possible ways it is important to count how often each of the $k$ vertices is used in the connecting tree.\n",
