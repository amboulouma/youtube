    "# Edge connectivity / Vertex connectivity\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an undirected graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges.\n",
    "Both the edge connectivity and the vertex connectivity are characteristics describing the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Edge connectivity\n",
    "\n",
    "The **edge connectivity** $\\lambda$ of the graph $G$ is the minimum number of edges that need to be deleted, such that the graph $G$ gets disconnected.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example an already disconnected graph has an edge connectivity of $0$, a connected graph with at least one bridge has an edge connectivity of $1$, and a connected graph with no bridges has an edge connectivity of at least $2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We say that a set $S$ of edges **separates** the vertices $s$ and $t$, if, after removing all edges in $S$ from the graph $G$, the vertices $s$ and $t$ end up in different connected components.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is clear, that the edge connectivity of a graph is equal to the minimum size of such a set separating two vertices $s$ and $t$, taken among all possible pairs $(s, t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vertex connectivity\n",
    "\n",
    "The **vertex connectivity** $\\kappa$ of the graph $G$ is the minimum number of vertices that need to be deleted, such that the graph $G$ gets disconnected.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example an already disconnected graph has the vertex connectivity $0$, and a connected graph with an articulation point has the vertex connectivity $1$.\n",
    "We define that a complete graph has the vertex connectivity $n-1$.\n",
    "For all other graphs the vertex connectivity doesn't exceed $n-2$, because you can find a pair of vertices which are not connected by an edge, and remove all other $n-2$ vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "We say that a set $T$ of vertices **separates** the vertices $s$ and $t$, if, after removing all vertices in $T$ from the graph $G$, the vertices end up in different connected components.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is clear, that the vertex connectivity of a graph is equal to the minimal size of such a set separating two vertices $s$ and $t$, taken among all possible pairs $(s, t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Whitney inequalities\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Whitney inequalities** (1932) gives a relation between the edge connectivity $\\lambda$, the vertex connectivity $\\kappa$ and the smallest degree of the vertices $\\delta$:\n",
    "$$\\kappa \\le \\lambda \\le \\delta$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively if we have a set of edges of size $\\lambda$, which make the graph disconnected, we can choose one of each end point, and create a set of vertices, that also disconnect the graph.\n",
    "And this set has size $\\le \\lambda$.\n",
    "\n",
    "And if we pick the vertex and the minimal degree $\\delta$, and remove all edges connected to it, then we also end up with a disconnected graph.\n",
    "Therefore the second inequality $\\lambda \\le \\delta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is interesting to note, that the Whitney inequalities cannot be improved:\n",
    "i.e. for any triple of numbers satisfying this inequality there exists at least one corresponding graph.\n",
    "One such graph can be constructed in the following way:\n",
    "The graph will consists of $2(\\delta + 1)$ vertices, the first $\\delta + 1$ vertices form a clique (all pairs of vertices are connected via an edge), and the second $\\delta + 1$ vertices form a second clique.\n",
    "In addition we connect the two cliques with $\\lambda$ edges, such that it uses $\\lambda$ different vertices in the first clique, and only $\\kappa$ vertices in the second clique.\n",
    "The resulting graph will have the three characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Ford-Fulkerson theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Ford-Fulkerson theorem** implies, that the biggest number of edge-disjoint paths connecting two vertices, is equal to the smallest number of edges separating these vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Computing the values\n",
    "\n",
    "### Edge connectivity using maximum flow\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is based on the Ford-Fulkerson theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "We iterate over all pairs of vertices $(s, t)$ and between each pair we find the largest number of disjoint paths between them.\n",
    "This value can be found using a maximum flow algorithm:\n",
    "we use $s$ as the source, $t$ as the sink, and assign each edge a capacity of $1$.\n",
    "Then the maximum flow is the number of disjoint paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "The complexity for the algorithm using [Edmonds-Karp](./graph/edmonds_karp.html) is $O(V^2 V E^2) = O(V^3 E^2)$. \n",
    "But we should note, that this includes a hidden factor, since it is practically impossible to create a graph such that the maximum flow algorithm will be slow for all sources and sinks.\n",
    "Especially the algorithm will run pretty fast for random graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Special algorithm for edge connectivity \n",
    "\n",
    "The task of finding the edge connectivity if equal to the task of finding the **global minimum cut**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Special algorithms have been developed for this task.\n",
    "One of them is the Stoer-Wagner algorithm, which works in $O(V^3)$ or $O(V E)$ time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vertex connectivity\n",
    "\n",
    "Again we iterate over all pairs of vertices $s$ and $t$, and for each pair we find the minimum number of vertices that separates $s$ and $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "By doing this, we can apply the same maximum flow approach as described in the previous sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "We split each vertex $x$ with $x \\neq s$ and $x \\neq t$ into two vertices $x_1$ and $x_2$.\n",
    "We connect these to vertices with a directed edge $(x_1, x_2)$ with the capacity $1$, and replace all edges $(u, v)$ by the two directed edges $(u_2, v_1)$ and $(v_2, u_1)$, both with the capacity of 1.\n",
    "The by the construction the value of the maximum flow will be equal to the minimum number of vertices that are needed to separate $s$ and $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach has the same complexity as the flow approach for finding the edge connectivity."
