    "<!--?title Number of paths with fixed length. Shortest Path of fixed length. -->\n",
    "# Number of paths of fixed length / Shortest paths of fixed length\n",
    "\n",
    "The following article describes solutions to these two problems built on the same idea:\n",
    "reduce the problem to the construction of matrix and compute the solution with the usual matrix multiplication or with a modified multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Number of paths of a fixed length\n",
    "\n",
    "We are given a directed, unweighted graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and we are given an integer $k$.\n",
    "The task is the following:\n",
    "for each pair of vertices $(i, j)$ we have to find the number of paths of length $k$ between these vertices.\n",
    "Paths don't have to be simple, i.e. vertices and edges can be visited any number of times in a single path.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that the graph is specified with an adjacency matrix, i.e. the matrix $G[][]$ of size $n \\times n$, where each element $G[i][j]$ equal to $1$ if the vertex $i$ is connected with $j$ by an edge, and $0$ is they are not connected by an edge.\n",
    "The following algorithm works also in the case of multiple edges:\n",
    "if some pair of vertices $(i, j)$ is connected with $m$ edges, then we can record this in the adjacency matrix by setting $G[i][j] = m$.\n",
    "Also the algorithm works if the graph contains loops (a loop is an edge that connect a vertex with itself).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is obvious that the constructed adjacency matrix if the answer to the problem for the case $k = 1$.\n",
    "It contains the number of paths of length $1$ between each pair of vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will build the solution iteratively:\n",
    "Let's assume we know the answer for some $k$.\n",
    "Here we describe a method how we can construct the answer for $k + 1$.\n",
    "Denote by $C_k$ the matrix for the case $k$, and by $C_{k+1}$ the matrix we want to construct.\n",
    "With the following formula we can compute every entry of $C_{k+1}$:\n",
    "$$C_{k+1}[i][j] = \\sum_{p = 1}^{n} C_k[i][p] \\cdot G[p][j]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy to see that the formula computes nothing other than the product of the matrices $C_k$ and $G$:\n",
    "$$C_{k+1} = C_k \\cdot G$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the solution of the problem can be represented as follows:\n",
    "$$C_k = \\underbrace{G \\cdot G \\cdots G}_{k \\text{ times}} = G^k$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It remains to note that the matrix products can be raised to a high power efficiently using [Binary exponentiation](./algebra/binary-exp.html).\n",
    "This gives a solution with $O(n^3 \\log k)$ complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Shortest paths of a fixed length\n",
    "\n",
    "We are given a directed weighted graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and an integer $k$.\n",
    "For each pair of vertices $(i, j)$ we have to find the length of the shortest path between $i$ and $j$ that consists of exactly $k$ edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that the graph is specified by an adjacency matrix, i.e. via the matrix $G[][]$ of size $n \\times n$ where each element $G[i][j]$ contains the length of the edges from the vertex $i$ to the vertex $j$.\n",
    "If there is no edge between two vertices, then the corresponding element of the matrix will be assigned to infinity $\\infty$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is obvious that in this form the adjacency matrix is the answer to the problem for $k = 1$.\n",
    "It contains the lengths of shortest paths between each pair of vertices, or $\\infty$ if a path consisting of one edge doesn't exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again we can build the solution to the problem iteratively:\n",
    "Let's assume we know the answer for some $k$.\n",
    "We show how we can compute the answer for $k+1$.\n",
    "Let us denote $L_k$ the matrix for $k$ and $L_{k+1}$ the matrix we want to build.\n",
    "Then the following formula computes each entry of $L_{k+1}$:\n",
    "$$L_{k+1}[i][j] = \\min_{p = 1 \\ldots n} \\left(L_k[i][p] + G[p][j]\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When looking closer at this formula, we can draw an analogy with the matrix multiplication:\n",
    "in fact the matrix $L_k$ is multiplied by the matrix $G$, the only difference is that instead in the multiplication operation we take the minimum instead of the sum.\n",
    "$$L_{k+1} = L_k \\odot G,$$\n",
    "where the operation $\\odot$ is defined as follows:\n",
    "$$A \\odot B = C~~\\Longleftrightarrow~~C_{i j} = \\min_{p = 1 \\ldots n}\\left(A_{i p} + B_{p j}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the solution of the task can be represented using the modified multiplication:\n",
    "$$L_k = \\underbrace{G \\odot \\ldots \\odot G}_{k~\\text{times}} = G^{\\odot k}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It remains to note that we also can compute this exponentiation efficiently with [Binary exponentiation](./algebra/binary-exp.html), because the modified multiplication is obviously associative.\n",
    "So also this solution has $O(n^3 \\log k)$ complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generalization of the problems for paths with length up to $k$\n",
    "\n",
    "The above solutions solve the problems for a fixed $k$.\n",
    "However the solutions can be adapted for solving problems for which the paths are allowed to contain no more than $k$ edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be done by slightly modifying the input graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "We duplicate each vertex:\n",
    "for each vertex $v$ we create one more vertex $v'$ and add the edge $(v, v')$ and the loop $(v', v')$.\n",
    "The number of paths between $i$ and $j$ with at most $k$ edges is the same number as the number of paths between $i$ and $j'$ with exactly $k + 1$ edges, since there is a bijection that maps every path $[p_0 = i,~p_1,~\\ldots,~p_{m-1},~p_m = j]$ of length $m \\le k$ to the path $[p_0 = i,~p_1,~\\ldots,~p_{m-1},~p_m = j, j', \\ldots, j']$ of length $k + 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same trick can be applied to compute the shortest paths with at most $k$ edges.\n",
    "We again duplicate each vertex and add the two mentioned edges with weight $0$."
