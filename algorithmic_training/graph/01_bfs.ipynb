    "# 0-1 BFS\n",
    "\n",
    "It is well-known, that you can find the shortest paths between a single source and all other vertices in $O(|E|)$ using [Breadth First Search](./graph/breadth-first-search.html) in an **unweighted graph**, i.e. the distance is the minimal number of edges that you need to traverse from the source to another vertex.\n",
    "We can interpret such a graph also as a weighted graph, where every edge has the weight $1$.\n",
    "If not all edges in graph have the same weight, that we need a more general algorithm, like [Dijkstra](./graph/dijkstra.html) which runs in $O(|V|^2 + |E|)$ or $O(|E| \\log |V|)$ time.\n",
    "\n",
    "However if the weights are more constrained, we can often do better.\n",
    "In this article we demonstrate how we can use BFS to solve the SSSP (single-source shortest path) problem in $O(|E|)$, if the weight of each edge is either $0$ or $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "We can develop the algorithm by closely study Dijkstra's algorithm and think about the consequences that our special graph implies.\n",
    "The general form of Dijkstra's algorithm is (here a `set` is used for the priority queue):\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "d.assign(n, INF);\n",
    "d[s] = 0;\n",
    "set<pair<int, int>> q;\n",
    "q.insert({0, s});\n",
    "while (!q.empty()) {\n",
    "    int v = q.begin()->second;\n",
    "    q.erase(q.begin());\n",
    "\n",
    "    for (auto edge : adj[v]) {\n",
    "        int u = edge.first;\n",
    "        int w = edge.second;\n",
    "\n",
    "        if (d[v] + w < d[u]) {\n",
    "            q.erase({d[u], u});\n",
    "            d[u] = d[v] + w;\n",
    "            q.insert({d[u], u});\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can notice that the difference between the distances between the source `s` and two other vertices in the queue differs by at most one.\n",
    "Especially, we know that $d[v] \\le d[u] \\le d[v] + 1$ for each $u \\in Q$.\n",
    "The reason for this is, that we only add vertices with equal distance or with distance plus one to the queue during each iteration.\n",
    "Assuming there exists a $u$ in the queue with $d[u] - d[v] > 1$, then $u$ must have been insert in the queue via a different vertex $t$ with $d[t] \\ge d[u] - 1 > d[v]$.\n",
    "However this is impossible, since Dijkstra's algorithm iterates over the vertices in increasing order.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means, that the order of the queue looks like this:\n",
    "$$Q = \\underbrace{v}\\_{d[v]}, \\dots, \\underbrace{u}\\_{d[v]}, \\underbrace{m}\\_{d[v]+1} \\dots \\underbrace{n}\\_{d[v]+1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure is so simple, that we don't need an actual priority queue, i.e. using a balanced binary tree would be an overkill.\n",
    "We can simply use a normal queue, and append new vertices at the beginning if the corresponding edge has weight $0$, i.e. if $d[u] = d[v]$, or at the end if the edge has weight $1$, i.e. if $d[u] = d[v] + 1$.\n",
    "This way the queue still remains sorted at all time.\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "vector<int> d(n, INF);\n",
    "d[s] = 0;\n",
    "deque<int> q;\n",
    "q.push_front(s);\n",
    "while (!q.empty()) {\n",
    "    int v = q.front();\n",
    "    q.pop_front();\n",
    "    for (auto edge : adj[v]) {\n",
    "        int u = edge.first;\n",
    "        int w = edge.second;\n",
    "        if (d[v] + w < d[u]) {\n",
    "            d[u] = d[v] + w;\n",
    "            if (w == 1)\n",
    "                q.push_back(u);\n",
    "            else\n",
    "                q.push_front(u);\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dial's algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "We can extend this even further if we allow the weights of the edges to be even bigger.\n",
    "If every edge in the graph has a weight $\\le k$, then the distances of vertices in the queue will differ by at most $k$ from the distance of $v$ to the source.\n",
    "So we can keep $k + 1$ buckets for the vertices in the queue, and whenever the bucket corresponding to the smallest distance gets empty, we make a cyclic shift to get the bucket with the next higher distance.\n",
    "This extension is called **Dial's algorithm**.\n",
