    "# D´Esopo-Pape algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges with weights $w_i$ and a starting vertex $v_0$.\n",
    "The task is to find the shortest path from the vertex $v_0$ to every other vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm from D´Esopo-Pape will work faster than [Dijkstra's algorithm](./graph/dijkstra.html) and the [Bellman-Ford algorithm](./graph/bellman_ford.html) in most cases, and will also work for negative edges.\n",
    "However not for negative cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Let the array $d$ contain the shortest path lengths, i.e. $d_i$ is the current length of the shortest path from the vertex $v_0$ to the vertex $i$.\n",
    "Initially this array is filled with infinity for every vertex, except $d_{v_0} = 0$.\n",
    "After the algorithm finishes, this array will contain the shortest distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let the array $p$ contain the current ancestors, i.e. $p_i$ is the direct ancestor of the vertex $i$ on the current shortest path from $v_0$ to $i$.\n",
    "Just like the array $d$, the array $p$ changes gradually during the algorithm and at the end takes its final values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now to the algorithm.\n",
    "At each step three sets of vertices are maintained:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $M_0$ - vertices, for which the distance has already been calculated (although it might not be the final distance)\n",
    "- $M_1$ - vertices, for which the distance currently is calculated\n",
    "- $M_2$ - vertices, for which the distance has not yet been calculated\n",
    "\n",
    "The vertices in the set $M_1$ are stored in a bidirectional queue (deque).\n",
    "\n",
    "At each step of the algorithm we take a vertex from the set $M_1$ (from the front of the queue).\n",
    "Let $u$ be the selected vertex.\n",
    "We put this vertex $u$ into the set $M_0$.\n",
    "Then we iterate over all edges coming out of this vertex.\n",
    "Let $v$ be the second end of the current edge, and $w$ its weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If $v$ belongs to $M_2$, then $v$ is inserted into the set $M_1$ by inserting it at the back of the queue.\n",
    "$d_v$ is set to $d_u + w$.\n",
    "- If $v$ belongs to $M_1$, then we try to improve the value of $d_v$: $d_v = \\min(d_v, d_u + w)$.\n",
    "Since $v$ is already in $M_1$, we don't need to insert it into $M_1$ and the queue.\n",
    "- If $v$ belongs to $M_0$, and if $d_v$ can be improved $d_v > d_u + w$, then we improve $d_v$ and insert the vertex $v$ back to the set $M_1$, placing it at the beginning of the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "And of course, with each update in the array $d$ we also have to update the corresponding element in the array $p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use an array $m$ to store in which set each vertex is currently.\n",
