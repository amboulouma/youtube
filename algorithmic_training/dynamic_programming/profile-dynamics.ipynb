    "Common problems solved using DP on broken profile include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- finding number of ways to fully fill an area (e.g. chessboard/grid) with some figures (e.g. dominoes)\n",
    "- finding a way to fill an area with minimum number of figures\n",

    "## Problem \"Parquet\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem description.** Given a grid of size $N \\times M$. Find number of ways to fill the grid with figures of size $2 \\times 1$ (no cell should be left unfilled, and figures should not overlap each other).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let the DP state be: $dp[i, mask]$, where $i = 1, \\ldots N$ and $mask = 0, \\ldots 2^M - 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$i$ represents number of rows in the current grid, and $mask$ is the state of last row of current grid. If $j$-th bit of $mask$ is $0$ then the corresponding cell is filled, otherwise it is unfilled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, the answer to the problem will be $dp[N, 0]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be building the DP state by iterating over each $i = 1, \\cdots N$ and each $mask = 0, \\ldots 2^M - 1$, and for each $mask$ we will be only transitioning forward, that is, we will be _adding_ figures to the current grid.\n",
