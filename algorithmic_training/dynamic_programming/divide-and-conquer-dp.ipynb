    "# Divide and Conquer DP\n",
    "\n",
    "Divide and Conquer is a dynamic programming optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preconditions\n",
    "Some dynamic programming problems have a recurrence of this form: $$dp(i, j) =\n",
    "\\min_{0 \\leq k \\leq j} \\\\{ dp(i - 1, k - 1) + C(k, j) \\\\}$$ Where $C(k, j)$ is a cost\n",
    "function and $dp(i, j) = 0$ when $j \\lt 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say $0 \\leq i \\lt m$ and $0 \\leq j \\lt n$, and evaluating $C$ takes $O(1)$\n",
    "time. Then the straightforward evaluation of the above recurrence is $O(m n^2)$. There\n",
    "are $m \\times n$ states, and $n$ transitions for each state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $opt(i, j)$ be the value of $k$ that minimizes the above expression. If\n",
    "$opt(i, j) \\leq opt(i, j + 1)$ for all $i, j$, then we can apply\n",
    "divide-and-conquer DP. This is known as the _monotonicity condition_. The optimal\n",
    "\"splitting point\" for a fixed $i$ increases as $j$ increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lets us solve for all states more efficiently. Say we compute $opt(i, j)$\n",
    "for some fixed $i$ and $j$. Then for any $j' < j$ we know that $opt(i, j') \\leq opt(i, j)$.\n",
    "This means when computing $opt(i, j')$, we don't have to consider as many\n",
    "splitting points!\n",
    "\n",
    "To minimize the runtime, we apply the idea behind divide and conquer. First,\n",
    "compute $opt(i, n / 2)$. Then, compute $opt(i, n / 4)$, knowing that it is less\n",
    "than or equal to $opt(i, n / 2)$ and $opt(i, 3 n / 4)$ knowing that it is\n",
    "greater than or equal to $opt(i, n / 2)$. By recursively keeping track of the\n",
    "lower and upper bounds on $opt$, we reach a $O(m n \\log n)$ runtime. Each\n",
    "possible value of $opt(i, j)$ only appears in $\\log n$ different nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that it doesn't matter how \"balanced\" $opt(i, j)$ is. Across a fixed\n",
    "level, each value of $k$ is used at most twice, and there are at most $\\log n$\n",
    "levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generic implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though implementation varies based on problem, here's a fairly generic\n",
    "template.\n",
    "The function `compute` computes one row $i$ of states `dp_cur`, given the previous row $i-1$ of states `dp_before`.\n",
    "It has to be called with `compute(0, n-1, 0, n-1)`. The function `solve` computes `m` rows and returns the result.\n",

    "### Things to look out for\n",
    "\n",
    "The greatest difficulty with Divide and Conquer DP problems is proving the\n",
    "monotonicity of $opt$. Many Divide and Conquer DP problems can also be solved\n",
    "with the Convex Hull trick or vice-versa. It is useful to know and understand\n",
